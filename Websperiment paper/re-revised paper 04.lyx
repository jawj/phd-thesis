\begin_layout Abstract
The Internet offers enormous possibilities for surveys and experimental
 data collection, including randomised treatments, customisation, and interactiv
ity.
 These capabilities are well suited to the implementation of choice modelling
 experiments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
However, the implementation of web surveys is not a simple task, and the
 existing options open to researchers are commonly unsatisfactory in a number
 of ways.
 The result is that few Internet surveys and experiments are able to exploit
 the unique capabilities of the web.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This paper suggests a new approach, illustrated with a working prototype:
 an open-source, domain-specific language (DSL) designed for specifying
 web surveys and experiments, which is called 
\emph on
websperiment
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The paper first looks at the existing approaches, highlighting their strengths
 and weaknesses.
 It then outlines the concepts underlying 
\emph on
websperiment
\emph default
, and this DSL's nature and scope, with simple code examples.
 Finally, it shows how the DSL can be used to concisely specify a highly
 dynamic choice modelling survey.

, and more.
 Web surveying is cheaper and faster than traditional approaches, and as
 universal Internet access edges ever closer, its biggest single drawback---an
 incomplete and biased sampling frame---is set to keep on diminishing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There has, rightly, been much interest in mode effects and in the sampling,
 validity, and design issues associated with web surveys 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "e.g."
key "marta-pedroso:2007,dillman:1998,schonlau:2002,couper:2008"

\end_inset

.
 There has, however, been rather little discussion regarding the practical
 implementation of such surveys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey implementation matters, and it matters arguably even more on the
 web than in some other modes: an online instrument must compensate for
 the lack of trained interviewers to administer it.
 Web survey implementation affects accessibility, compatibility and consistency
 across respondents; it affects respondent motivation and experience; it
 creates context effects, and has implications for data security.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementation is a genuinely difficult problem.
 It is subject to the combined challenges both of good generic survey implementa
tion and of good generic web application implementation
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The latter include not only the general challenges associated with IT service
 development, in which effective communication of requirements is a key
 factor, but a further host of technical characteristics related to the
 web.
 For example: respondents must be tracked across separate page requests,
 overcoming the statelessness of the underlying protocol, HTTP; limited,
 inconsistent and incompatible browser, operating system and hardware capabiliti
es and settings must all be accommodated; logic must be split or duplicated
 between the server and untrusted clients; and in spite of all this, an
 attractive, consistent and easily navigated user interface must be maintained.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is a problem which increases in scale in tandem with the potential rewards:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the more complexity one builds into the instrument, the greater the cost
 and effort required to program and test the survey, and the greater the
 likelihood that something might not work as intended

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementation is arguably a problem which has yet to be satisfactorily
 addressed.
 Few Internet surveys currently exploit the unique capabilities of the web:
 most function simply as on-screen representations of a paper-and-pencil
 design.
 Furthermore, even such unambitious representations are rarely executed
 well.

\begin_layout Standard
In the hope of helping to improve web survey implementation, this paper
 suggests a new approach, embodied in and illustrated by a working prototype.
 The approach has three distinctive aspects.
 First, it involves the development of a 'domain-specific' programming language
 (DSL).
 Second, it makes liberal use of a mechanism known as 'inheritance', an
 important element in object-oriented programming.
 Finally, it is open source.
 These are somewhat technical concepts

Existing survey implementation options
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Researchers trying to implement a survey or experiment online generally
 choose one of four major options: a managed web-based service; a locally-instal
led software application; a specialist consultancy; or some form of Do-It-Yourse
lf (that is: pick a programming language, and start writing code).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
(a) Managed web-based service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These services enable a survey to be designed via a web-based Graphical
 User Interface (GUI), and then hosted on the provider's server.
 Popular web-based services include: SurveyMonkey, QuestionPro, Zoomerang
 and Wufoo, which are principally business-focused; Bristol Online Surveys,
 which has a more academic flavour; and various offerings from Confirmit,
 which aims more specifically at market research professionals.
 Typically a web-based service is a relatively low-cost option offering
 rather basic features.
 Often it also produces an unattractive and poorly accessible survey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "kuipers:2005"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, the popular service Survey Monkey uses non-standard custom
 form controls (check-boxes, radio buttons and so on).
 These controls are unfamiliar to web users, and raise accessibility issues
 both in terms of disabled users (screen reading software will not recognise
 them) and web browser configuration (respondents without JavaScript enabled,
 including many who are subject to institutional IT security policies, see
 only the message 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Bristol Online Surveys, to which many UK academic institutions subscribe,
 provides no routing capabilities and does not use the HTML

 tag for form controls (this is disability-unfriendly, and also makes the
 controls an inconveniently small click target).
 Some other services provide no 'previous page' control (and break when
 the browser's 'back' button is used), require Java or Adobe Flash, or exclude
 non-Windows users.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to implement a choice experiment with these services via
 the traditional pen-and-paper strategy of creating multiple versions of
 the survey instrument, differing only in the attribute levels displayed
 within the choice cards section (this can be coupled with a simple server-side
 script which redirects visitors to one of the multiple survey versions
 at random).
 Depending on the capabilities of the service used, formatted items such
 as tables may have to be inserted as images, and in this case the information
 will not be accessible to screen-reader software.

(b) Locally-installed software application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boundaries between web-based services and locally-installed software
 are increasingly becoming blurred, but locally-installed software generally
 provides a more advanced feature set then the web-based services discussed
 above.
 Like web-based services, locally-installed software generally offers a
 comprehensive GUI for survey design.
 GUIs should facilitiate discovery of the software's features and eliminate
 some kinds of input error.
 Survey design GUIs may be somewhat clumsy, however, with option-heavy dialogue-
boxes nested many levels deep (see The Survey System software illustrated
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:thesurveysystem"

\end_inset

, for example).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Locally-installed survey software may be expensive, particularly if the
 cost cannot be spread across multiple projects, and is generally subject
 to restrictive licencing terms regarding who may install and use it, on
 what scale, and for how long.
 Once a survey is designed, arrangements must then be made for hosting online.
 Most software providers offer paid hosting options, and/or enable the export
 of scripting files and supporting resources for hosting on your own server.
 The latter option will generally require particular server features, such
 as the availability of a scripting language (e.g.
 Perl) or the use of a particular platform (e.g.
 Microsoft Windows with Internet Information Services (IIS) server software).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some software is designed specifically for the implementation of online
 choice experiments, and can automatically generate a range of experimental
 designs based on the attributes and levels specified---an extremely useful
 capability.

(c) Specialist consultancy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of engaging consultants ultimately depend, obviously, on the
 skills and experience of the consultants.
 However, a consultancy itself may well be using one of the options discussed
 above, in which case the service offered will be subject to the same strengths
 and limitations.
 Achieving precise communication of requirements is likely to be a significant
 challenge, and some level of control will be lost.
 This option is also liable to be expensive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
(d) Do-It-Yourself development
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Creating a web survey using nothing more than a general purpose programming
 language allows complete control and flexibility, and is an option that
 has been advocated elsewhere 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g."
key "fraley:2004"

\end_inset

.
 To do a good job, however, one needs (or needs access to) user interface
 expertise, visual design and programming skills, and web design experience.
 Even assuming all these things are available, having researchers everywhere
 re-implement basic web survey features---and even generic web application
 features---represents an extraordinary duplication of effort.
 It is also liable to result in little-tested and therefore buggy software,
 and to prove costly in time and salaries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
General limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of the available options make it easy for researchers to share survey
 items or item types, or build on such work shared by others (in the way,
 say, that researchers can share their own work and make use of others'
 in the form of new routines or libraries for statistical software packages).
 Nor do these options typically make it easy to describe the underlying
 mechanics of a survey, either for communicating with co-authors or for
 reporting research methods externally (for example: What is the page-to-page
 skip logic? How are dynamic response options calculated? Which options
 are shown in randomised order?).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Options (a) -- (c) above generally keep the workings of a survey either
 entirely opaque or spread throughout a series of GUI locations, while option
 (d) will likely produce code that is verbose and complex, where the house-keepi
ng noise of saving data, specifying layout and so on overwhelms the details
 relevant to survey specification.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
A new approach
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:technical-stuff"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The new approach suggested here is the use of a domain-specific language
 (DSL).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A DSL for surveys is not truly novel: there is one existing example, Topsl,
 described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "machenry:2004"

\end_inset

.
 Topsl's aims, capabilities and implementation are very different, however.
 First, Topsl requires surveys to be amenable to static analysis, so that
 the same source can either be displayed as web pages or formatted for printing.
 While this is undoubtedly useful if a hard copy is required, it removes
 at one stroke most of the power gained by moving surveys online.
 Second, Topsl is implemented in the programming language Scheme, a dialect
 of Lisp.
 Scheme is elegant, minimalist, and well suited to DSLs.
 However, it is also littered with parentheses and highly unlike natural
 language, making it rather difficult to understand (or indeed write) the
 survey code.
 Finally, Topsl includes a bare minimum of features and is not a realistic
 option for presenting real surveys.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This DSL approach is related to the Do-It-Yourself development option in
 the discussion above, and retains its total flexibility.
 However, it addresses both major drawbacks of that option: first, the need
 for extensive expertise in web design; and second, the need to re-implement
 basic web application and web survey features from scratch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A domain-specific language...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DSLs are programming languages designed to address a particular, limited
 problem space (as opposed to the general-purpose languages, such as C,
 Java, Perl and Python, in which most computer software is written).
 Many researchers will be familiar with one or more DSLs already.
 For example, in statistical packages that provide a syntax for describing
 and combining operations---including R, Stata, Limdep/NLOGIT, and SPSS---this
 syntax is well described as a DSL.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other popular examples are LaTeX (for document typesetting/formatting),
 PostScript (page layout), SQL (querying and managing databases), CSS (web
 page formatting), Regular Expressions (text processing), XSLT (transforming
 XML documents) and the configuration files of the Apache web server and
 many other Unix tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What do DSLs do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DSLs are designed to reflect the structure and content of the problem domain,
 making it straightforward to create and connect common items, actions and
 rules to form larger systems.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "16"
key "sprinkle:2009"

\end_inset

 explain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Ideally, a DSL follows the domain abstractions and semantics as closely
 as possible, letting developers perceive themselves as working directly
 with domain concepts.
 The created specifications might then represent simultaneously the design,
 implementation, and documentation of the system...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
DSLs come in various flavours, differing in flexibility, syntax and purpose.
 Some, such as SQL, are purely or distinctively declarative: they require
 a description only of what should be done, and give no guarantees as to
 the order or method for doing it.
 Others are imperative: they require us to specify and sequence the steps
 involved.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

A distinction is sometimes drawn between internal (or embedded) and external
 (or standalone) DSLs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fowler:2009a"

\end_inset

.
 An external DSL has its own syntax, parser, and unique set of capabilities.
 An internal DSL, meanwhile, is a framework that extends an existing general
 purpose language.
 Some general purpose languages are more suited to hosting internal DSLs
 than others: key factors include the suitability of the syntax and the
 presence of 'meta-programming' features that make the language easy to
 extend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Internal DSLs have several benefits.
 They are easy to implement.
 They get the capacities of their host language, including its existing
 function libraries, completely free.
 For those who know the host language, they use a familiar syntax; and for
 those that do not, they offer an easy way in to learning it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Who are DSLs for?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DSLs are still essentially programming languages.
 They are picky about punctuation, capital letters and matching brackets,
 and getting things wrong may sometimes produce unhelpful error messages.
 In short, they are probably languages which those who have some basic programmi
ng experience---at the level, say, of writing an R script, Stata DO file,
 or SPSS syntax file---will feel more comfortable writing in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For these developers, using a DSL may allow a substantial increase in productivi
ty.
 In general, DSLs can cut development time by between 60% and 90% compared
 to standard, general-purpose programming approaches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "22--25"
key "kelly:2008"

\end_inset

.
 The value of using a DSL is by no means limited to those who write in it,
 though.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "14"
key "fowler:2009a"

\end_inset

 notes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
the key value is providing a business-readable DSL, where domain experts
 can read the code, understand what it means, and talk to programmers directly
 about necessary modifications.
 It's much easier to make DSLs business readable rather than business writable,
 but you gain most of the benefits by enhancing communication.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Ruby's syntax is relatively close to that of natural language, and it has
 strong facilities for 'meta-programming', a means of extending the language
 by using code that itself writes code.
 These attributes make it well suited to creating internal DSLs (in fact,
 many current Ruby users were introduced to the language by a popular DSL

Admittedly, this is not a very interesting survey.
 In fact, it stays well within what is possible using a free web-based service.
 However, the key advantage of the DSL approach is that it allows for this
 near-effortless implementation of standard survey features, without constrainin
g the researcher's freedom to do essentially anything at all.

For example, with simple declarative statements we could: pick a question
 completion policy (optional, mandatory or prompted) and a custom prompt
 message; specify answer validation logic, skip logic (for both pages and
 questions), and dependencies between questions; and enable quota sample
 management and referral tracking.
 But because we are working within a general-purpose programming language,
 we have the full capabilities of that language and its libraries available
 too.
 For example, we could use the outputs of other programs, such as GIS databases,
 or of calls to external web services.

OOP is not the only mainstream software paradigm: not all problems are most

\begin_layout Standard
The objects of OOP are conceptually cohesive entities that generally model
 and reflect things in the outside world.
 Objects consist both of data and of behaviours (or 'methods') that work
 with that data.
 Objects interact by passing messages, which ask that specific methods be
 invoked.
 OOP uses these objects, and their interactions, in the design and implementatio
n of larger systems (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "snyder:1986,armstrong:2006"

\end_inset

).
 For example, OOP is increasingly used in agent-based modelling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "benenson:2004"

: objects in these studies can model agents such as the vehicles within
 traffic flows, or households making decisions regarding where to locate

 For example, a computer game might make use of Monster objects; these might

OOP systems have two particularly useful properties for the purposes of
 a web surveys DSL: encapsulation/polymorphism and inheritance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Encapsulation and polymorphism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To use an OOP object, we need information about what it can do: this public
 list of behaviours is known as its interface.
 For example, in 
\emph on
websperiment
\emph default
, the 
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\ttfamily},breakautoindent=true,breaklines=true,commentstyle={\color{grey}},frame=tb,framerule={0.25pt},framexbottommargin={5.5pt},framextopmargin={5.5pt},language=Ruby,morecomment={[s]{\ \:}{\ }},showstringspaces=false,stringstyle={\itshape},tabsize=2"

answer
\end_layout

\end_inset

 method is part of the interface of all types of question objects: it reports
 the answer given by the current survey respondent to the question represented
 by that object (this could be used, for example, in routing to subsequent
 pages).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
But the means by which an object executes these methods---its implementation---i
s private, or encapsulated.
 For example, one question might call out to a web service to help determine
 parts of its display text; another might make a calculation based on its
 answers from all previous respondents.
 The containing page, survey, and system as a whole need not know anything
 about this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Encapsulation benefits the development of a system because it should make
 different objects relatively decoupled or independent.
 This means we can implement the same object in any one of many different
 ways (if we discover a bug in one of our questions, say, or a potential
 optimisation) without worry that we will accidentally break some other
 part of the system.
 It also means we can use the same object in many different places.
 For example, a newly developed question that follows the standard interface---b
y offering the 
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\ttfamily},breakautoindent=true,breaklines=true,commentstyle={\color{grey}},frame=tb,framerule={0.25pt},framexbottommargin={5.5pt},framextopmargin={5.5pt},language=Ruby,morecomment={[s]{\ \:}{\ }},showstringspaces=false,stringstyle={\itshape},tabsize=2"

\end_inset

 method, and a few others---can be slotted in at any point of any survey.
 This capability is known as polymorphism.
 It promotes the efficient reuse of code within a survey, and from one survey
 (and one researcher) to the next.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The alternative to encapsulation is the kind of 'spaghetti code' system
 in which many parts are dependent in complex ways on many others (for example,
 by reading from and writing to a big pool of common data).
 In this kind of system, change is difficult (as it is liable to break something
 unforeseen elsewhere) and individual parts have indeterminate boundaries
 and are difficult or impossible to extract for reuse elsewhere.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects in an OOP system can 'inherit' data and behaviours from other objects
 in a hierarchy or tree.
 This makes it easy to create objects that build on or modify the abilities
 of other objects.
 In OOP terminology, one creates subclasses of (or one simply 'subclasses')
 the original object class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This process was seen in action in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "lst:simplequestion"

\end_inset

.
 When the first survey page was created, it was declared as a new subclass
 of the basic page class, 
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\normalsize\ttfamily},breakautoindent=true,breaklines=true,commentstyle={\color{grey}},frame=tb,framerule={0.25pt},framexbottommargin={5.5pt},framextopmargin={5.5pt},language=Ruby,morecomment={[s]{\ \:}{\ }},showstringspaces=false,stringstyle={\itshape},tabsize=2"

 The new page therefore inherited all the standard data and behaviours required

 the survey as a progress bar, and so on.
 A block of code was then added, between the

 It thus inherited all the data and behaviours required of a radio-button
 question: specifying response options, displaying these as radio buttons,

 Again, additional data and behaviours were then specified in the subsequent
 block of code (in this case, some question text and two response options).

Of course, there is no obligation to share code, and a class that reveals
 too much about confidential research might be unsuitable for sharing.
 Additionally, to guard against the proliferation of poorly-written or excessive

\begin_layout Standard
Although defaults have been chosen with care, the presentation of surveys
 is entirely customisable.
 Ease of customisation depends, obviously, on the extent of the customisations
 desired.
 Images are easily included within question and page declarations.
 Colours, fonts, and dimensions can be altered with simple modification
 to CSS stylesheets.
 Larger structural changes might require modification of HTML templates,
 or tweaks to the Ruby code.

On the respondent side, surveys are marked up in standards-compliant HTML,
 CSS and JavaScript, and are compatible with all major browser platforms,
 including Internet Explorer 6+, Mozilla (including Firefox), Webkit (including
 Safari, Chrome, the iPhone's Mobile Safari, and the Android Browser) and
 Opera.
 All built-in JavaScript is unobtrusive, in the sense that users without
 it are still able to complete the survey, although questions that rely
 on JavaScript may be unavailable, and there may be intra-page routing instructi
ons to follow.

A surveys DSL is well suited to constructing web-based choice experiments,
 since these can be relatively complex and dynamic surveys.
 For a recent study on vehicle fuel choice, several reusable custom object
 classes were developed within

 These classes are now shared as part of the

 from scratch is not necessarily a major task: those discussed below represent
 no more than than a day's work).
 This section discusses a bare-bones choice experiment based on these classes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first attribute is defined on lines 3 -- 6.
 Line 3 gives the attribute a name, by which it can be identified elsewhere
 in the code.
 Line 4 defines its levels: the series of integers from 1 to 9 inclusive.
 Line 5 specifies the status quo level, which will be used as the value
 for the status quo option to be shown on every choice card.
 Line 6 specifies that higher values are less desirable: this information
 enables the randomisation algorithm to detect when one option (i.e.
 a combination of levels) is dominated by another.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Option A is dominated by option B if it is worse than B in one or more of
 its attributes, and not better in any.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For qualitative attributes, or other attributes where the desirability
 of different levels is not known in advance, this line would be omitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second attribute is defined similarly on lines 7 -- 10, and the third
 on lines 11 -- 14.
 For the third attribute, the status quo level is set dynamically to the
 respondent's local fuel price as already queried online (line 13).
 The full set of levels is then defined as deviations from this value (line
 12).

, and using the values returned by the block as the values comprising the
 new array.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For this reason, the whole attribute set is specified as dependent on the
 status quo price (line 2).
 This means that if there is a change in the status quo price (which could
 in this case be caused only by a change to the postcode), the attribute
 levels will be cleared and recalculated accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, having defined the attributes and their levels, attributes must be
 combined into options, and options combined into choice cards.
 This is accomplished by lines 17 -- 20, which specify that two randomised
 options are to be generated, labelled 'a' and 'b', alongside a status quo
 option, labelled 'c'.

Researchers have up to now usually had to pick one of four main options
 when implementing surveys and choice experiments online: web-based services,
 local software, consultants, or Do-It-Yourself from scratch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementing a web-based survey or experiment using a DSL such as the 
\emph on
websperiment
\emph default
 prototype, it has been argued, has a number of advantages over the options
 previously available.
 These include: improved productivity, leading to reduced time and cost
 of implementation; greater flexibility and extensibility, enabling arbitrarily
 advanced features; and wider accessibility and browser compatibility, permittin
g a broader sampling frame and a superior experience for respondents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advantages also include easier communication and sharing, both within
 a specific research project and (where relevant) more broadly within the
 academic process.
 This is for three main reasons: first, because the DSL is readable by domain
 experts who need not be experts in web survey implementation; second, because
 it is designed in a modular way, using reusable, sharable classes; and
 third, because it is unencumbered by proprietary licence restrictions.

\emph on
websperiment 
\emph default
has already been used to implement several online surveys and experiments,
 but it is not a finished product.
 Researchers are strongly encouraged to use and contribute to the development
 of the project.

Technical details
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For the curious and expert, websperiment is built using: on the server:
 MySQL, Ruby (1.9) on Rails, and various Ruby gems including RedCloth, Hpricot;
 in the web browser: Prototype + Scriptaculous for simulated class-based
 OOP, language extensions, and animation support.
 Produces standards-compliant XHTML, CSS and JavaScript, and is 100% compatible
 with IE6+, Mozilla (Firefox, Netscape), Webkit (Safari, Chrome, iPhone,
 Konqueror) and Opera.
 JavaScript is all unobtrusive, in the sense that those without JavaScript
 are still able to complete the survey (questions that rely on JavaScript
 may be unavailable, and there may be intra-page routing instructions to
 follow).
 On a Linux VPS with 360MB memory (can be had for < £20/month), it can handle
 10 -- 15 requests per second using Passenger---enough for about 100 concurrent
 respondents.
