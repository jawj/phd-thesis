Signalling protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Random, variable-interval assessments initiated by a researcher-induced
 signal are standard in ESM and common in EMA studies.
 Assuming perfect compliance, such 'signal-contingent sampling' provides
 a representative and unbiased selection of participants' experiences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "shiffman:2007"

\end_inset

.
 Conversely, assessments initiated at participants' discretion may be unrepresen
tative due to self-selection, while assessments at regular, predictable
 intervals may be unrepresentative because of regularities in activities
 or moods, or because participants can modify their behaviour in anticipation
 of an assessment

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scheduling
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:scheduling"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple, random, and entirely non-predictable algorithm for scheduling
 assessments could rely on a fixed probability of signalling each respondent
 in each of many brief time periods.
 For example, to signal each participant on average once a day, we might
 cycle through the participant list every minute during the 720 minutes
 between 8am and 8pm and, for each participant, signal him or her with a
 probability of 1/720.
 In practice, this simple algorithm is almost certainly 
\emph on
too
\emph default
 random.
 Using it, participants would occasionally experience very long or very
 short gaps between signals.
 Very long gaps might lead them to suspect a malfunction, while very short
 gaps could cause significant annoyance (and produce identical or near-identical
 responses that would add little information to the data set).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead, most previous studies have therefore split the day into fixed blocks,
 and signalled each participant at a moment picked at random within each
 block, often subject to a constraint on the proximity of consecutive signals
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "41"
key "hektner:2007"

\end_inset

.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "209"
key "turk:2007"

\end_inset

 define three blocks (8am -- noon, noon -- 4pm, and 4 -- 8pm) and ensure
 that consecutive signals are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scheduled to occur no closer than 2 hours apart
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, using fixed blocks increases the predictability of the schedule.
 For example, in the study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "turk:2007"

\end_inset

, if I have not been signalled by 11.50am then I know that I will be signalled
 in the next 10 minutes, and if I am then signalled at 11.55am I know I will
 not be signalled again before 1.55pm.
 Using fixed blocks also makes it complicated to maintain a uniform random
 sample of moments while also constraining the proximity of consecutive
 signals.
 (Researchers have generally not revealed how their constraint on the proximity
 of consecutive signals is implemented, but various na√Øve implementations
 --- such as discarding schedules where the constraint is broken, and re-randomi
sing until the constraint holds --- would lead to significant under-sampling
 of the periods on either side of the switch-over between consecutive blocks).

\end_layout

\end_inset

To reduce (although not eliminate) predictability, and to maintain a uniform
 random sample with relative ease, the algorithm developed for Mappiness
 effectively also randomises the start and end times of blocks.
 This algorithm operates as illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, which shows example calculations for a participant who is to be beeped

 study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Signalling period, hours and frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having chosen a scheduling algorithm, three key parameters of the signalling
 protocol remain to be set.
 These are: first, the total period during which participants will be signalled;
 second, the frequency with which signals will be sent (the product of these
 first two parameters being the total number of signals per participant);
 and third, since we do not want to interrupt participants' sleep, the hours
 of the day during which signals will and will not be sent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most previous studies have employed a fixed total period and frequency across
 all participants.
 Periods have ranged from a few days to several months, and frequencies
 have varied between 1 and more than 10 signals per day.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "delespaul:2003"

\end_inset

 offers some rules of thumb: 10 signals daily may be acceptable over a period
 of one week, while sampling over longer periods should not exceed 6 signals/day.
 The choice of parameters is influenced by the frequency of occurrence of
 the phenomena of interest, the quantity of data required for anticipated
 analyses, and the degree of burden on participants 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "40--42"
key "hektner:2007"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many studies have also used fixed hours of the day: for example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "csikszentmihalyi:2001a"

\end_inset

 signalled all participants between 7.30am and 10.30pm.
 However, this approach is far from ideal.
 First, it requires that the signalling hours be truncated at each end to
 accommodate a large majority of waking and sleeping times.
 Most participants will thus not be signalled across the full length of
 their waking days, compromising the representativeness of the sample of
 experiences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "238"
key "stone:2002b"

\end_inset

.
 Second, potential participants with an unusual or variable pattern of waking
 hours, such as those working shifts, are still effectively excluded from
 taking part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed above, Mappiness seeks to analyse the association of mood with
 experiences of green and natural environments that are expected to be both
 rare and of only moderate influence on it.
 Therefore we wish to maximise both participation rate and the number of
 signalled assessments per participant.
 With this aim --- and also respecting the diversity and autonomy of participant
s --- Mappiness places all three parameters under participants' control,
 subject to conservative, low-burden minima/maxima and defaults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frequency of signals can at any time be set to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 per day,
 with a default setting of 2.
 Participants can at any time choose the hours during which they may be
 signalled, specifying start and end times to the nearest 15 minutes, with
 a default range of 8am -- 10pm
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We considered supporting more flexible specification of signalling hours
 --- such as by providing separate settings for weekdays and weekends, or
 for every day of the week --- but decided that the associated benefits
 would not justify the added complexity required for the user interface.
 Participants can still achieve an arbitrarily complex pattern of signalling
 hours by making alterations to these hours as necessary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The total period of participation is unbounded: participants are asked
 to take part for as long or short a period as they wish, and instructed
 that they are free to opt out of the study whenever they choose.
 Because we hope that participants will find interest and value in taking
 part, we do not wish to restrict their ability to continue doing so, while
 also contributing useful data.
 And although some researchers have found that data quality from an individual
 diminishes after 2 -- 3 weeks of sampling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "beal:2003"

\end_inset

, any such effect may be detected and dealt with as necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reachability and response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain requirements inevitably restrict the sample of experiences captured
 by a signal-contingent sampling study.
 For a signal to be received and a response given, a participant must be:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
in possession of the signalling device (which must be charged and switched
 on); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
in an area with wireless data reception (e.g.
 not on an underground rail system or in a remote rural area); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
able to hear the signal (e.g.
 not at a noisy bar or building site); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
able to safely respond (e.g.
 not driving); and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
willing to do so.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use of the iPhone has a number of advantages over traditional pager- or
 PDA-based ESM protocols in relation to the first point.
 The device is portable and convenient.
 Since it is already owned and provides many other functions to the user,
 it is also likely to be kept charged, switched on and within reach without
 any additional burden on participants.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the second point, base stations operated by all UK mobile communicatio
ns providers now cover the vast majority of the country.
 Remote, rural locations, which are likely to be of particular environmental
 interest, are unfortunately also the least likely to enjoy coverage, however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Missing and delayed data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If any of the five requirements listed above is not met, the response to
 a signal may be missing or delayed.
 Various choices have been made in previous studies regarding the protocol
 to be followed in this case.
 In some studies, participants are permitted to complete an assessment only
 if they react to a signal 'immediately' (e.g.
 within 30 seconds).
 In other studies, participants are given a longer period in which to respond
 --- during which reminder signals might or might not be sent --- or permitted
 to actively request a postponement of the assessment.
 If delayed responses are permitted, then the target of reporting must be
 established as either

\end_layout

\end_inset

Mappiness allows an ESM assessment to be completed in response to a signal
 at any time up to the receipt of the next signal.
 If participants do not hear a signal, they can nevertheless ascertain that
 a response is pending by the presence of a red badge on the Mappiness app's
 icon.
 The delay between signal and response is calculated and stored, so that
 maximum allowable delays may be applied as required during data analysis.
 Mappiness does encourage participants to respond quickly and consistently,
 however, and response statistics are displayed prominently on the app's
 main screen.
 As illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:app-main-screen"

\end_inset

, the following statistics are shown: total number of assessments completed;
 response rate (the number of signalled responses divided by the number
 of signals sent); and median (which is labelled as 'typical') response
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The target of a Mappiness assessment is always the moment of recording,
 whether or not this is later than the moment of signalling.
 This policy is easiest for participants, and does not risk introducing
 elements of the recall bias that ESM is designed to eliminate.
 This policy is also the only one that is feasible, since the GPS location
 data, sound level and (where applicable) photograph will inevitably pertain
 to the moment of recording.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Suspension of signalling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some ESM protocols enable participants to suspend signalling when signals
 would be embarrassing or inconvenient.
 As with other elements of the protocol, the decision to offer such a facility
 hinges on a trade-off between the convenience (and acceptability) of the
 protocol to participants and the integrity of the sampling scheme 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "stone:2002"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:signalling"

\end_inset

, Mappiness signals are delivered by the Apple Push Notification Service,
 which conforms to the user's overall alert settings for his or her device.
 Mappiness signal alert sounds are delivered at the highest possible volume
 subject to the user's currently selected limit.
 If the user has silenced the device, Mappiness signals will also be silenced.
 If the user has opted for a vibrating alert in silenced and/or non-silenced
 mode, Mappiness signals will also vibrate in those modes.
 Of course, participants are also able to turn off their device, and in
 that case cannot receive signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mappiness thus effectively offers temporary suspension of signalling alongside
 other device-wide settings.
 On the one hand, this restricts our control over signalling; on the other,
 it provides for the greatest consistency with participants' expectations,
 and is respectful of their existing preferences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Volunteered assessments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mappiness permits ESM assessments to be volunteered at any time.
 A volunteered assessment is defined as one completed when no assessment
 is pending: in other words, when the most recent signal (if any) has already
 been responded to.
 As we inform participants, volunteered responses will not be included in
 our analyses.
 However, they still serve several purposes.
 First, participants may wish to record particular experiences for their
 own reference.
 Second, newly-registered participants may wish to explore the mechanics
 of the ESM response process immediately (and, in fact, a large majority
 do).
 Finally, participants are able to use a volunteered response to demonstrate
 the response process to friends and acquaintances who are interested in
 the study and may wish to take part themselves.

 Local Notifications would have some advantages over Push Notifications
 --- chiefly, that they would not require an active data connection, and
 so could be received at any location.
 Used alone, they would also have disadvantages --- no more than 64 Local
 Notifications may be scheduled, and if the app is not opened before these
 expire then no more notifications can be received.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A notification can be delivered at any time the target device is available
 --- that is, powered on and connected to the Internet --- whether or not
 the relevant app is open.
 If the device is available, a notification is usually delivered within
 a few seconds; if it is not, the notification is queued for delivery at
 the next opportunity.
 Delivery of notifications

is 'best effort' and is not guaranteed

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

after "31"
key "apple-inc.:2010a"

\end_inset

, although testing indicates that the vast majority of notifications are
 delivered successfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an app provider attempts to send a notification to an app which no longer
 exists on the target device, the device reports this to the APNS, which
 updates an app-specific list of devices for which there were failed delivery
 attempts.
 App providers are obliged to query a feedback service regularly to retrieve
 this list, and to refrain from sending future notifications to the listed
 devices unless they are subsequently re-registered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Communicating with the APNS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mappiness uses APNS notifications to signal participants.
 Communicating with the APNS requires use of a proprietary binary protocol
 over a persistent, authenticated connection.
 Managing such a connection is somewhat technically demanding, and Mappiness
 therefore relies on intermediary software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially, the free tier of a commercial service operated by Urban Airship,
 Inc.

 However, the volume of notifications to be sent rapidly approached the
 usage limits of the free service tier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After evaluating various alternatives we therefore installed an additional
 open-source software package on the Mappiness data server: PyAPNS

.
 Like the Urban Airship service, PyAPNS handles all communication with the
 APNS and is controlled by a simple API.
 The PyAPNS API communicates over XML-RPC

\end_layout

\end_inset

, but also provides a Ruby client library to encapsulate this communication.
 The Mappiness signalling software was rewritten to use the PyAPNS client
 library (to which we also contributed several fixes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Signalling using APNS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mappiness makes use of the three available APNS features: it plays an alert
 sound, displays a textual message, and causes the number '1' to be displayed
 on a red badge over the app's icon to indicate that there is one ESM survey
 pending.

\end_inset

The alert sound is chosen by participants from a list within the app settings
 screen.
 The message reads: '
\series bold
mappiness
\series default
 --- How do you feel? Please tell us as soon as you safely can'.
 If the device is unlocked, two associated buttons are displayed: 'Close'
 dismisses the notification, and 'View' launches the Mappiness app directly
 into ESM survey mode.
 If the device is locked, a slider is available to launch the app into ESM
 survey mode.
 Notification display is illustrated in

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Signalling is performed by the signalling programme on the Mappiness data
 server.
 The programme is executed every 2 minutes, and on each execution performs
 the following sequence of tasks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Connect to the APNS feedback service to retrieve a list of app installations
 with failed deliveries.
 Mark all listed installations inactive in the users database table, and
 delete any pending signals associated with them from the
\emph on
 
\emph default
pending_beeps table.
 (This task is only performed if it has not been performed in the past hour).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each participant who has reached the end of signalling hours since the
 last programme execution, calculate the signalling schedule for the next
 day according to the algorithm described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:scheduling"

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, for each participant who has changed their beep settings since
 last programme execution, recalculate the signalling schedule for the remaining
 hours of this day (if applicable)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If settings are changed during the (potentially newly set) hours of the
 participant's signalling day, the number of signals to be sent during the
 remainder of the day is calculated on a probabilistic 
\emph on
pro rata 
\emph default
basis.
 For example, a participant who selects to receive 3 signals per day half-way
 through a day is theoretically due 1.5 signals during the remainder of the
 day.
 He or she will thus certainly be sent 1 signal, and will be sent a second
 with a probability of 50%.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or for the next day.
 Store the resulting pending signals in the
\emph on
 
\emph default
pending_beeps table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each signal in the pending_beeps table that has fallen due since the
 last programme execution, delete the pending signal, send an APNS notification
 to the associated participant, and create a record of the sent signal in
 the sent_beeps table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Safeguards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Foreseeable failure modes of the signalling system could antagonise participants.
 For example, participants might be woken from sleep if they were were signalled
 outside the hours they have specified, or feel harassed and irritated if
 they were signalled many times over a short period of time.
 In such cases, the reputation of the project --- and its ability to recruit
 and keep participants --- could be damaged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The signalling system was therefore implemented defensively, to try to prevent
 such failures.
 For example, the system considers the hours during which a participant
 may be beeped as finishing 10 minutes prior to the time specified by the
 participant, to account for possible delays in notification delivery.
 It deletes pending signals from the database prior to attempting their
 delivery, so that further deliveries will not be attempted during the next
 execution if an error occurs during the deletion phase.
 And it refuses to proceed (and emails the system administrator) if more
 than a certain number of signals appear to fall due at one moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Mappiness app communicates with the data server via the private data
 API.
 The data API is a web application that receives and sends JSON messages
 over an encrypted HTTPS connection.
 It is written using the Sinatra framework for Ruby and served by the Phusion
 Passenger module for the nginx web server (all open-source).

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 The data API makes the following nine endpoints available to the app:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
register is called on completion of the participant sign-up process.
 The app sends details of the APNS device token required for sending signals
 to the registering device, and of the participant's confirmed signalling
 settings (both of which are stored in the users table).
 It also sends the participant's answers to the registration survey (which
 are stored in demographic_answer_sets).
 In response, the API returns a unique participant ID and a random 20-character
 secret.
 The app stores these, and uses them to authenticate itself (using HTTP
 Basic authentication) for all future API requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
esm_answers is called with new ESM assessment responses, which are stored
 in the esm_answer_sets
\emph on
 
\emph default
table.
 The API also links the response set with the signal it was given in response
 to (if applicable) in the sent_beeps table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
image is called with the JPEG image data resulting from a photo taken during
 an ESM assessment, and a code identifying this associated ESM assessment.
 The image is stored in the filesystem.
 If it was marked as public, it is also made accessible from the maps page
 of the public Mappiness website.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
user_status is called on app launch or when there are no further ESM assessment
 responses queued for sending to the API.
 The API calculates and returns the response statistics alongside a status
 message to be displayed on the main screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
graphs_bluff is called when the participant taps the 'My happiness' control.
 The API returns instructions for displaying the participant's feedback
 charts (using the Bluff

 charting library for JavaScript) as an HTML+CSS+JavaScript document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
settings is called when the participant changes his or her signalling settings.
 The new settings are stored in the users table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
toggle_download is called when the participant enables or disables data
 download.
 When enabling data download, the API returns the new, secret HTTPS URL
 via which the participant's data may be accessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
update_token is called if the app detects that its APNS device token has
 changed.
 The message includes the new device token, which is stored in the users
 table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
apn_ignored is called in the rare case that the app receives an APNS notificatio
n that cannot be displayed because another modal activity is in progress
 (such as completing an ESM assessment or changing signalling settings).
 The API flags the relevant notification in the sent_beeps database table
 to indicate that it should not count towards the total signals received
 by the participant.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The signal is not rescheduled, so the participant receives fewer than the
 scheduled number of signals on the day in question.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Asynchronous endpoint priorities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four of the API endpoints listed above are handled asynchronously by the
 Mappiness app.
 In other words, communication with these endpoints occurs in the background,
 without blocking other app functions.
 These endpoints are: update_token, esm_answers, image, and apn_ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The app manages a single queue of messages to the asynchronous endpoints.
 If the queue is not empty and no asynchronous message is currently being
 transmitted, the app will begin sending the message at the head of the
 queue.
 Reflecting the importance of different endpoints to the data collection
 process, the message queue is ordered by endpoint priority.
 The endpoints are listed in descending priority order in the preceding
 paragraph.
 For example, all ESM assessment response data will be transmitted before
 any image is sent.
 Messages for the same endpoint are processed in first-in-first-out order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Security and backup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Security against intrusions is essential for participants' privacy and for
 the integrity of the collected data.
 The data servers are firewalled to prevent access to any services but the
 Mappiness data services (over HTTP and HTTPS) and a secure shell (SSH)
 for system administration.
 All installed software is updated regularly to ensure that known exploits
 are patched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To guard against the loss of collected data in case of intrusion, hardware
 failure or other disaster, an offsite backup is performed daily.
 The backup is made in the early hours of the morning (UK time), when load
 on the server is at its lowest.
 The Mappiness backup script invokes the open-source Duplicity software

 S3 provides durable and redundant data storage across multiple devices
 and physical locations.
 To comply with Data Protection Act requirements, backup data is stored
 only on S3 servers located within the EU (Ireland).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Backups are encrypted, and also transmitted over an encrypted connection.
 Full backups are performed monthly, and the daily backups occurring in
 between are incremental: only changes relative to the previous backup are
 transmitted and stored.
 Each backup creates a snapshot, so that the data that was held on the server
 on any particular day can be restored.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Snapshots are crucial to the effectiveness of backup.
 Without snapshots, corruption or deletion of data on the server is quickly
 mirrored to the backup, rendering it useless.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To verify that data is being backed up correctly, data for analysis is
 retrieved not directly from the production server, but from the latest
 backup instead.
 This strategy also reduces load on the production server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Web statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The public Mappiness web site has four elements that require up-to-date
 statistics from the production data server.
 These are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a count at the bottom of every page of the total number of participants
 that have signed up;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a map of the most recent 120 responses where the 'happy' self-rating was
 at least 70%, and a photo was taken and allowed to be displayed;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
'hedonimeters' displaying the average and current happiness ratings for
 London and the whole of the UK --- these are the means of respectively
 all responses and the 25 most recent responses; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a chart showing the mean happiness response for the UK and London, hour-by-hour
 during the past week --- excluding any hours for which there were fewer
 than 10 responses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statistics for the hour-by-hour chart are calculated at the beginning of
 the hour, and statistics for the others are calculated every 5 minutes,
 by programmes executed on the appropriate schedule.
 The statistics are saved (in JSON format) in a directory accessible over
 an HTTP connection, and are loaded as required by the public website.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Download API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an additional incentive, participants are able to access all of their
 own contributed data.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This feature was added with the launch of version 1.1 of the app in May 2011.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The data download feature is initially disabled for each participant, it
 can be enabled and disabled within the app.
 When it is enabled, the participant's data is available via a secure (HTTPS)
 link.
 To ensure privacy, this link cannot be guessed --- it includes 8 random
 characters --- and it changes each time the download feature is enabled.
\begin_inset Foot

 they are easily visually confused).
 The 8-character string can therefore take any of 
\begin_inset Formula $28^{8}$

 (approximately 378 billion) values.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data download is made available by another web application built using the
 Sinatra framework.
 Several formats are supported:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
HTML reproducing the charts available within the app (which can then be
 emailed, saved or printed), and providing a gallery of the photos submitted
 by the participant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
KMZ for exploration within mapping applications such as Google Earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
iCalendar for viewing (and subscription) within calendaring applications
 such as iCal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
CSV for import into spreadsheet or statistics applications, for subsequent
 graphing or statistical analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
JSON for consumption by third-party services.
 For example, services could be developed to display a personal 'hedonimeter'
 on a participant's own blog, to post details of responses to a participant's
 Twitter or Facebook account, or to provide a participant with more detailed
 analysis of his or her responses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all formats except HTML charts, response data are provided in descending
 order of response date/time, and the web application accepts query parameters
 limiting the data to be returned by date/time and sequence.
