\begin_layout Standard
This chapter describes the spatial experience sampling data collection methodolo
gy we develop and implement as part of our second research strand, looking
 at momentary SWB in relation to people's immediate surroundings.
 Elements of this method are entirely novel, and the whole is novel in the
 contexts of happiness economics and studies of the impacts of EQ.
 We therefore provide a reasonably thorough exposition, although certain
 details, and the most technical aspects of the implementation, are elaborated
 further in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:esm-appendix"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data set collected by this method is related but rather different to
 that gathered in the survey research described in the previous chapter.
 Here we ask individuals for simple, instantaneous assessments of SWB alongside
 some contextual information.
 While they answer, current location is recorded, which is later used to
 join responses with other spatial (and time-varying) data.
 For each study participant there are repeated interactions, producing a
 large, panel-structured data set.
 This data set allows us to approach our over-arching subject --- links
 between happiness and EQ --- at a more detailed and disaggregated level
 than has previously been attempted: not at country or even person level,
 but at the scale of individual, momentary experiences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Priorities
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:esm-aims-and-objectives"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We focus on an EQ indicator for which high-resolution UK-wide data are available
: land cover types (to be discussed further in the next chapter), including
 different types of green and blue space.
 To test our research hypothesis on links between links between momentary
 happiness and EQ will therefore require that we observe amongst our ESM
 assessments some experiences of these natural environments.
 These experiences are expected to occur with relatively low frequency,
 and may have only a moderate impact on happiness.
 We may thus need to collect a large number of ESM assessments in order
 to obtain enough relating to the natural environment for our hypothesis
 tests to have reasonable statistical power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason a key priority informing many aspects of the study's design,
 implementation and operation is to maximise the number of participants
 recruited, and the number of assessments completed by each.
 This implies a number of subordinate objectives, including:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Low
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

participant
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

burden Signing up and continuing to take part in the study both need to
 require as little as possible in terms of time, logistical difficulty and
 cognitive effort.
 These processes should be fast, simple, attractive and --- ideally ---
 fun.
 They will ideally involve no typing.
 They should be capable of completion using only the participant's handheld
 device --- for example, there should be no need to meet or speak to researchers
, or use a desktop computer.
 We will want to minimise the amount of information requested from participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
High
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

participant
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

motivation It is important to reach and then motivate prospective participants
 to sign up to the study, and to keep existing participants engaged in taking
 part.
 This will require us to produce and publicise information about and data
 from the study in an accessible and interesting format.
 Keeping participants engaged may also be assisted by the provision of stimulati
ng feedback about their own responses, especially if the value of this feedback
 increases with the degree of participation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Low
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

researcher
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

burden In order to support a large number of participants and responses,
 each participant and each response must not require a large investment
 of researcher time, logistical support, or money (since none of these is
 in abundant supply).
 For example, it would be impractical to ask a large number of open-ended
 questions requiring manual coding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
High

 large volume of participants and responses.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Life satisfaction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first screen presents a standard life satisfaction (LS) item.
 It is based on the European Social Survey item used in the two web surveys
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:survey-design-happiness"

\end_inset

).
 However, owing to constraints of space on the iPhone screen, the preamble
 'All things considered' is eliminated from the question text, and the response
 scale is truncated to run from 1 -- 10 instead of 0 -- 10.
 We ask this generalised and evaluative/cognitive wellbeing question for
 comparison with individuals' later momentary assessment responses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Health
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then present a simple, standard self-assessed health item (the response
 categories here are the same as used in the Canadian National Population
 Health Survey, for example).
 We ask this question because health status is invariably an important predictor
 of wellbeing responses in the literature.
 We also ask a simple Yes/No question about asthma and other respiratory
 disease, because these may be important factors mediating the impact of
 air pollution on wellbeing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Demographics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next ask questions on gender, age, marital and relationship status, work
 status and household composition.
 The age question is framed as year of birth --- this provides year-level
 precision, and is known to give high accuracy and low non-response rate
 compared to other options, such as a choice of age bands 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "healey:2008"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We ask these demographic questions in order to characterise our sample in
 relation to the wider population; because age, marital/relationship status
 and work status have strong associations with wellbeing in the literature;
 and because information on household composition allows us to calculate
 equivalised income levels using the income data discussed next.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Income
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we present questions on income.
 We first ask about gross annual household income, providing 11 response
 bands, with fairly wide bands at the very bottom (since iPhone owners are
 not expected to be very poor) and across the top end (reflecting the diminishin
g marginal utility of income).
 We also provide 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Prefer not to say
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 options because of the relative difficulty and sensitivity of the question.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We ask this question in order to characterise our sample in relation to
 the wider population; because previous research finds a significant positive
 effect of income on wellbeing; and because income information may enable
 us to use wellbeing responses for monetary valuation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we ask up to two somewhat experimental questions about changes in
 income over the past 3 years: whether there has there been a change up
 or down and, if there has been, the magnitude of the change in one of 6
 bands (defined in absolute money amounts).
 Again we allow

Don't know
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Prefer not to say

\end_inset

 responses.
 We ask this question because lagged income has been shown in many studies
 to be an important correlate of wellbeing, and its omission in valuation
 studies may lead to an upward bias in SWB-derived valuation estimates

Update 1.1 of the app, released in May 2011, added a 'Notes' item for free

 For participants, open-ended responses would be more cognitively demanding,
 slower, and awkward to enter using the iPhone's on-screen keyboard.
 In addition, manual coding of the answers would be infeasible if the large
 desired sample were to be achieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first external dimension of experience listed above, time, is captured
 automatically.
 Using the iPhone's sensing capabilities the second dimension, location,
 is extended to include the participant's objective geographical coordinates,
 and two further dimensions are added: noise level, and an image of the
 participant's immediate environment.
 These sensed data are discussed further in

\begin_layout Paragraph
Wellbeing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information we collect on the internal dimensions of experience is limited
 to three simple items.
 We present these on the first screen of the ESM assessment survey.
 Visual analogue scales are used, implemented as slider controls, because
 of their sensitivity to small variations and (somewhat subjectively) because
 the user experience is enhanced by their high degree of interactivity.
 Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they feel 'happy', 'relaxed'
 and 'awake' on these scales, in each case between 'not at all' on the far
 left and 'extremely' on the far right.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 'happy' response is of primary interest in this study.
 The other two adjectives were chosen as being reasonably orthogonal to
 happiness and to each other, and as being plausibly affected by environmental
 factors.
 In all three cases we chose familiar, everyday terms in order to increase
 acceptance by participants, and presented unipolar items for simplicity
 (a bipolar item scale, by contrast, might put 'very sad' on the left and
 'very happy' on the right).
 We chose to emphasise positive aspects of mood in each case --- 'happy',
 'relaxed' and 'awake' rather than 'sad', 'stressed' and 'tired' --- to
 help communicate the study's positive purpose and emphasis on positive
 impacts on wellbeing, and for simplicity and consistency of the relevant
 survey screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Companionship
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next ask whom the participant is currently with.
 The participant can tap 'Alone, or with strangers only' to proceed immediately
 to the next question, or tick all applicable categories and then tap 'Next'.
 The categories offered are based on those used in previous ESM surveys.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For brevity, we do not distinguish between being alone and being only with
 people unknown to the participant.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Location type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To provide context for the GPS-sensed location coordinates we then present
 two simple items regarding location type.
 We ask whether the participant is indoors, outdoors or in a vehicle, since
 this is expected to be an important mediator of the impact of the outdoor
 environment --- for which spatial data is available --- on wellbeing.
 And we ask whether the participant is at home, at work, or neither: first,
 because the home and work locations may have important non-environmental
 effects on wellbeing; and second, because they are likely to account for
 a large proportion of the participants' time, and their associated environments
 may therefore represent an important baseline for other environmental experienc
es.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Activities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we ask what the participant is currently doing.
 For simplicity, we present a single list of activities (as an alternative,
 we initially considered using some form of nested categorisation).
 Participants are asked to tick all activities that apply.
 To proceed, at least one activity (or the final option, 'Something else')
 must be ticked.
 Again for simplicity, we do not ask participants to distinguish between
 primary and secondary activities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The list of activities presented is informed by three sources: the UK 2000
 Time Use Survey Activity Coding List 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "Appendix 3"
key "office-for-national-statistics:2003"

\end_inset

, the American Time Use Survey 2009 Activity Lexicon 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bureau-of-labor-statistics:2009"

\end_inset

, and the large-scale ESM study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "killingsworth:2010"

\end_inset

.
 Drafting a single list of activities that is comprehensive but of a manageable
 length requires subjective judgment and some challenging compromises.
 For example, certain of our activities are arguably too broad --- 'Shopping,
 errands' has to cover both the purchase of mundane necessities and shopping
 undertaken as a leisure activity ('retail therapy').
 Similarly, certain activities that represent arguably distinct experiences
 are combined into a single category: 'Hunting, fishing', for instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The activities are presented in a broadly thematic order, proceeding from
 work-related activities through chores and errands to leisure activities.
 We considered randomising the order of response options per response or
 per participant to counter possible ordering effects.
 However, the disadvantages of this approach were considered to outweigh
 the benefits.
 Both forms of randomisation would result in an arbitrary ordering of items
 that would be more difficult to navigate.
 In addition, per response randomisation might confuse participants, and
 would prevent any learning of the list order, again impeding navigation
 of the list.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The activities list was updated once after launch, with app update 1.0.2 in
 September 2010.
 Five new categories were added: 'Intimacy, making love', 'Texting, emailing,
 social media', 'Browsing the Internet', 'Drinking tea/coffee', and 'Birdwatchin
g, nature watching'.
 The first four categories were added based on participant feedback.
 The last, 'Birdwatching, nature watching' was added because we thought
 it a potentially important omission in relation to experiences of natural
 environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adding activity categories inevitably results in reduced comparability of
 responses made before and after the change.
 To maximise comparability, however, we changed the coding of the 'Something
 else' option in the same app update, to reflect that this was now an option
 encompassing a narrower range of activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In app update 1.1 participants were enabled to add optional textual notes,
 using a button provided at the end of the activities list.
 This feature was added primarily to increase the usefulness of the downloaded
 data to participants, and so act as an incentive to participation.
 However, if patterns emerge in the words or phrases used, it could also
 prove useful in assessing what items and/or options should be added to
 the survey in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Photo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The participant may next be asked to take a photo straight ahead.
 By default, we ask this only when the participant has indicated that he
 or she is outdoors --- both for reasons of privacy, and to save time on
 the majority of assessment occasions.
 However, as of app update 1.0.2 participants can choose instead to be prompted
 for a photo on every occasion, or not at all (and can also choose, in response
 to several participant requests, to have all photos taken within the app
 saved to their on-device photo album).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The participant can decline the request to take a photo by tapping 'Cancel'.
 After taking a photo, the participant can tap either 'Retake' or 'Use'.
 If the participant successfully takes a photo, he or she is then asked
 whether it may be added to the map on the public website.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Location accuracy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the participant has indicated that he or she is outdoors, an accurate
 location estimate should also be obtainable by the GPS sensor, and is particula
rly important to our research.
 In this case, therefore, if the accuracy of the GPS-reported location is
 worse than 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $-$
\end_inset

 100m then the participant will be asked to wait while the device continues
 to try to determine location.
 This location accuracy screen dismisses itself automatically after 60 seconds
 or as soon as location accuracy reaches 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $-$
\end_inset

 100m or better.
 The participant is also able to tap 'Skip' to proceed at any time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Item order and context effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the design of the registration and ESM assessment surveys, the same principle
s of item ordering were followed as in the web surveys, as discussed in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "par:Item-order"

\end_inset

.
 In each case the wellbeing item is presented first, to minimise context
 effects (for the ESM assessment, the item is presented immediately upon
 app launch if an assessment is pending).
 In the registration survey, the income items are presented last, being
 probably the most sensitive.
 Again to minimise context effects --- and the possibility of induced correlatio
n --- no mention is made in the surveys or in any in-app feedback of the
 research hypothesis or of environmental factors.

\begin_layout Section
Signalling protocol
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Random, variable-interval assessments initiated by a researcher-induced
 signal are standard in ESM and common in EMA studies.
 Assuming perfect compliance, such 'signal-contingent sampling' provides
 a representative and unbiased selection of participants' experiences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "shiffman:2007"

\end_inset

.
 Conversely, assessments initiated at participants' discretion may be unrepresen
tative due to self-selection, while assessments at regular, predictable
 intervals may be unrepresentative because of regularities in activities
 or moods, or because participants can modify their behaviour in anticipation
 of an assessment

\begin_layout Subsection
Scheduling
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:scheduling"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple, random, and entirely non-predictable algorithm for scheduling
 assessments could rely on a fixed probability of signalling each respondent
 in each of many brief time periods.
 For example, to signal each participant on average once a day, we might
 cycle through the participant list every minute during the 720 minutes
 between 8am and 8pm and, for each participant, signal him or her with a
 probability of 1/720.
 In practice, this simple algorithm is almost certainly 
\emph on
too
\emph default
 random.
 Using it, participants would occasionally experience very long or very
 short gaps between signals.
 Very long gaps might lead them to suspect a malfunction, while very short
 gaps could cause significant annoyance (and produce identical or near-identical
 responses that would add little information to the data set).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead, most previous studies have therefore split the day into fixed blocks,
 and signalled each participant at a moment picked at random within each
 block, often subject to a constraint on the proximity of consecutive signals
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "41"
key "hektner:2007"

\end_inset

.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "209"
key "turk:2007"

\end_inset

 define three blocks (8am -- noon, noon -- 4pm, and 4 -- 8pm) and ensure
 that consecutive signals are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scheduled to occur no closer than 2 hours apart
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, using fixed blocks increases the predictability of the schedule.
 For example, in the study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "turk:2007"

\end_inset

, if I have not been signalled by 11.50am then I know that I will be signalled
 in the next 10 minutes, and if I am then signalled at 11.55am I know I will
 not be signalled again before 1.55pm.
 Using fixed blocks also makes it complicated to maintain a uniform random
 sample of moments while also constraining the proximity of consecutive
 signals.
 (Researchers have generally not revealed how their constraint on the proximity
 of consecutive signals is implemented, but various naïve implementations
 --- such as discarding schedules where the constraint is broken, and re-randomi
sing until the constraint holds --- would lead to significant under-sampling
 of the periods on either side of the switch-over between consecutive blocks).

To reduce (although not eliminate) predictability, and to maintain a uniform
 random sample with relative ease, the algorithm developed for Mappiness
 effectively also randomises the start and end times of blocks.
 This algorithm operates as illustrated in

Signalling period, hours and frequency
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having chosen a scheduling algorithm, three key parameters of the signalling
 protocol remain to be set.
 These are: first, the total period during which participants will be signalled;
 second, the frequency with which signals will be sent (the product of these
 first two parameters being the total number of signals per participant);
 and third, since we do not want to interrupt participants' sleep, the hours
 of the day during which signals will and will not be sent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most previous studies have employed a fixed total period and frequency across
 all participants.
 Periods have ranged from a few days to several months, and frequencies
 have varied between 1 and more than 10 signals per day.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "delespaul:2003"

\end_inset

 offers some rules of thumb: 10 signals daily may be acceptable over a period
 of one week, while sampling over longer periods should not exceed 6 signals/day.
 The choice of parameters is influenced by the frequency of occurrence of
 the phenomena of interest, the quantity of data required for anticipated
 analyses, and the degree of burden on participants 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "40--42"
key "hektner:2007"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many studies have also used fixed hours of the day: for example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "csikszentmihalyi:2001a"

\end_inset

 signalled all participants between 7.30am and 10.30pm.
 However, this approach is far from ideal.
 First, it requires that the signalling hours be truncated at each end to
 accommodate the majority of waking and sleeping times.
 Most participants will thus not be signalled across the full length of
 their waking days, compromising the representativeness of the sample of
 experiences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "238"
key "stone:2002"

\end_inset

.
 Second, potential participants with an unusual or variable pattern of waking
 hours, such as those working shifts, are still effectively excluded from
 taking part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed above, Mappiness seeks to analyse the association of mood with
 experiences of green and natural environments that are expected to be both
 rare and of only moderate influence on it.
 Therefore we wish to maximise both participation rate and the number of
 signalled assessments per participant.
 With this aim --- and also respecting the diversity and autonomy of participant
s --- Mappiness places all three parameters under participants' control,
 subject to conservative, low-burden minima/maxima and defaults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frequency of signals can at any time be set to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 per day,
 with a default setting of 2.
 Participants can at any time choose the hours during which they may be
 signalled, specifying start and end times to the nearest 15 minutes, with
 a default range of 8am -- 10pm
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We considered supporting more flexible specification of signalling hours
 --- such as by providing separate settings for weekdays and weekends, or
 for every day of the week --- but decided that the associated benefits
 would not justify the added complexity required for the user interface.
 Participants can still achieve an arbitrarily complex pattern of signalling
 hours by making alterations to these hours as necessary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The total period of participation is unbounded: participants are asked
 to take part for as long or short a period as they wish, and instructed
 that they are free to opt out of the study whenever they choose.
 Because we hope that participants will find interest and value in taking
 part, we do not wish to restrict their ability to continue doing so, while
 also contributing useful data.
 And although some researchers have found that data quality from an individual
 diminishes after 2 -- 3 weeks of sampling

Certain requirements inevitably restrict the sample of experiences captured

 For a signal to be received and a response given, a participant must be:

in possession of the signalling device (which must be charged and switched
 on); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
in an area with wireless data reception (e.g.

Use of the iPhone has a number of advantages over traditional pager- or

 any additional burden on participants.

\begin_layout Standard
If any of the five requirements listed above is not met, the response to
 a signal may be missing or delayed.
 Various choices have been made in previous studies regarding the protocol
 to be followed in this case.
 In some studies, participants are permitted to complete an assessment only
 if they react to a signal 'immediately' (e.g.
 within 30 seconds).
 In other studies, participants are given a longer period in which to respond
 --- during which reminder signals might or might not be sent --- or permitted
 to actively request a postponement of the assessment.
 If delayed responses are permitted, then the target of reporting must be
 established as either

Mappiness allows an ESM assessment to be completed in response to a signal
 at any time up to the receipt of the next signal.
 If participants do not hear a signal, they can nevertheless ascertain that
 a response is pending by the presence of a red badge on the Mappiness app's
 icon.
 The delay between signal and response is calculated and stored, so that
 maximum allowable delays may be applied as required during data analysis.
 Mappiness does encourage participants to respond quickly and consistently,
 however, and response statistics are displayed prominently on the app's
 main screen.
 As illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:app-main-screen"

\end_inset

, the following statistics are shown: total number of assessments completed;
 response rate (the number of signalled responses divided by the number
 of signals sent); and median (which is labelled as 'typical') response
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The target of a Mappiness assessment is always the moment of recording,
 whether or not this is later than the moment of signalling.
 This policy is easiest for participants, and does not risk introducing
 elements of the recall bias that ESM is designed to eliminate.
 This policy is also the only one that is feasible, since the GPS location
 data, sound level and (where applicable) photograph will inevitably pertain
 to the moment of recording.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Suspension of signalling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some ESM protocols enable participants to suspend signalling when signals
 would be embarrassing or inconvenient.
 As with other elements of the protocol, the decision to offer such a facility
 hinges on a trade-off between the convenience (and acceptability) of the
 protocol to participants and the integrity of the sampling scheme 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:signalling"

\end_inset

, Mappiness signals are delivered by the Apple Push Notification Service,
 which conforms to the user's overall alert settings for his or her device.
 Mappiness signal alert sounds are delivered at the highest possible volume
 subject to the user's currently selected limit.
 If the user has silenced the device, Mappiness signals will also be silenced.
 If the user has opted for a vibrating alert in silenced and/or non-silenced
 mode, Mappiness signals will also vibrate in those modes.
 Of course, participants are also able to turn off their device, and in
 that case cannot receive signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mappiness thus effectively offers temporary suspension of signalling alongside
 other device-wide settings.
 On the one hand, this restricts our control over signalling; on the other,
 it provides for the greatest consistency with participants' expectations,
 and is respectful of their existing preferences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Volunteered assessments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mappiness permits ESM assessments to be volunteered at any time.
 A volunteered assessment is defined as one completed when no assessment
 is pending: in other words, when the most recent signal (if any) has already
 been responded to.
 As we inform participants, volunteered responses will not be included in
 our analyses.
 However, they still serve several purposes.
 First, participants may wish to record particular experiences for their
 own reference.
 Second, newly-registered participants may wish to explore the mechanics
 of the ESM response process immediately (and, in fact, a large majority
 do).
 Finally, participants are able to use a volunteered response to demonstrate
 the response process to friends and acquaintances who are interested in
 the study and may wish to take part themselves.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Surveys
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two types of surveys are conducted within the app: the one-off registration
 survey, and the repeated ESM assessment survey.
 The two share a common visual and interaction design, and are supported
 by the same generic survey interface implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For speed, and to minimise context effects, the ESM survey appears immediately
 on app launch if an ESM assessment is pending.
 Also for speed, both surveys dismiss themselves automatically when the
 final question is answered.
 In each case, the first survey screen provides a 'Cancel' button that discontin
ues the survey, and subsequent screens each provide a 'Back' button to return
 to the preceding screen in case a response error has been made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Omitted or inconsistent responses are prevented by selective disabling of
 certain response options.
 For example, in the Feelings item of the ESM survey, the 'Next >' button
 is disabled until all three response scale sliders have been interacted
 with.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey completion may be interrupted if the participant exits the app or
 receives a telephone call on the device.
 If the ESM assessment survey is interrupted, answers up to the current
 point are saved, and are sent to the data server the next time the app
 is opened.
 Answers are not saved if the registration survey is interrupted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both surveys are implemented using standard Cocoa Touch interface controls,
 which are professionally designed and familiar to iPhone users.
 Different questions use different control types, often in combination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
'Choose one' items
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most multiple choice items with a single answer, such as the gender item
 in the registration survey, use table view cells with the chevron-shaped
 'disclosure' indicator.
 When a participant taps a cell, their response is registered and the survey
 immediately proceeds to the next screen.
 Table view cells present a large tap target for the participant, and the
 disclosure indicator elicits the correct expectation that tapping will
 cause the survey to advance.
 A table view cell with disclosure indicator is also used to present the
 participant with a 
\emph on
Next >
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
Skip >
\emph default
 option following other interactions on a survey screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the year of birth registration survey item, the picker control is used
 instead.
 The picker control shows response options on a rotating wheel, and is better
 suited to the display of a large number of response options.
 We set the initial position of the picker to 1975: we expect this to be
 around the middle of the response range, and this minimises the distance
 participants will need to scroll.
 There is however a risk that some participants will leave the the picker
 in this position to advance most quickly.

Scale items
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The life satisfaction item in the registration survey is answered on an
 ordinal scale with labelled endpoints: for compactness, and for greatest
 similarity with such scales in other survey media, this item is implemented
 using a segmented control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feelings items in the ESM assessment survey are answered on visual analog
 scales, and these are implemented using slider controls.
 We replaced the standard circular slider 'thumb' with a similar but larger
 version, to provide a larger and therefore easier target for interaction.
 As a result of feedback from piloting, we also added tick marks along the
 top edge of the slider to help participants judge the slider position.
 The slider thumb starts in the middle position, but the slider track appears
 in grey until the thumb has been tapped or moved, to indicate that this
 is not a selected position.
 While the default positioning of the slider thumb may lead to anchoring
 effects, this appears unavoidable.

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the data obtained by survey during an ESM assessment, other
 data is collected using the capabilities of the participant's iPhone and
 the data server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Time and date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The moment of signalling is recorded by the data server.
 This will not be precisely the same moment that the signal is delivered
 to the participant's device, but in practice it will usually be close.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The moment that the participant began responding is reported by the app.
 For this we are reliant on the accuracy of the clock setting on the participant
's iPhone.
 In general, this should not present a problem, since the device defaults
 to automatic synchronisation of the clock with the network provider.
 The app also reports the time taken to complete the response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Location
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The device's Assisted Global Positioning System (A-GPS) subsystem is activated
 at the beginning of the ESM assessment process, and the device location
 is queried at the end, to allow the longest possible time for an accurate
 location fix to be achieved
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We use the iPhone's Core Location framework 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "apple-inc.:2010b"

\end_inset

 to query the device's location.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the participant is indoors --- with no line-of-sight to GPS satellites
 --- the device will calculate location by triangulation of known wireless
 Internet (WiFi) access points and mobile telephony base-stations.
 In this situation, accuracy will vary considerably depending on proximity
 to such known locations, and in the worst case no location data will be
 available.
 However, the estimated accuracy of the calculated location is reported
 by the device in all cases, reducing the risk that inaccurate location
 data will bias our analyses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the participant is outdoors, a more accurate location estimate should
 be available using GPS.
 Therefore, as discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Mappiness-ESM-assessment"

\end_inset

, if the participant has indicated in the ESM survey that he or she is outdoors,
 we check before completing the survey that the estimated location accuracy
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $-$
\end_inset

 100m or better.
 If it is not, we wait for up to 60 seconds for a better estimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specifications of the GPS receiver in the iPhone are not published,
 although it is known that later models have improved hardware.
 The meaning of the reported accuracy bounds --- such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $-$
\end_inset

 100m
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 --- is also not stated (is it, for example, a 95% confidence interval?).
 The nature of the error in location estimates is therefore not known with
 certainty.
 However, everyday use of the device for other purposes indicates that the
 true location is almost invariably within the reported accuracy bounds
 of the reported estimate.

 Sound level readings are returned on a logarithmic scale, between –160
 (no sound detectable by the microphone) and 0 (loudest sound measurable
 by the microphone) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "apple-inc.:2010c"

\end_inset

.
 The specifications of the iPhone's microphone are, again, not published,
 and may vary between device models.
 The microphone is likely to be directional, so detected noise levels may
 depend substantially on the orientation of the device relative to the sources
 of noise.
 If the participant is listening to music (or other audio) using the device,
 the sound level is not measured
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Measuring the sound level in this situation would interrupt the participant's
 listening.
 In addition, the external sound level is arguably not relevant if the participa

 pixels --- and obtain a compressed (JPEG) representation for speedy transmissio
n over the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different iPhone models have different camera hardware: some later models
 offer higher resolutions, auto-focus, better performance in low light levels,
 and LED illumination.
 Unfortunately, it is not possible to retrieve metadata from the photo,
 so no indication of light level (via exposure settings) or of the use of
 the LED is available.
 The iPhone also has a light sensor, which is used to vary the screen brightness
 in response to background conditions.
 Unfortunately this sensor's output is also inaccessible to application
 code.

The data server was designed to run itself with no routine intervention,
 but was subject to ongoing monitoring.
 During the first few weeks a number of minor bugs that had not been uncovered
 during testing were fixed.
 In addition, the data server was upgraded, and optimisations were made
 to the code, database schema and server configuration, in order to deal
 with the unexpectedly large number of participants.
 The data server software was also subject to periodic updates to enhance
 the charts and other information provided on the

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Testers were provided with the app prior to release in the App Store using
 Apple's Ad Hoc distribution method.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Testers were asked to comment on the reliability and stability of the app's
 implementation, the usability and aesthetics of the user interface, and
 the clarity and style of explanatory text.
 The testing phase also served as the pilot for the registration and ESM
 assessment surveys, and testers were asked debriefing questions in relation
 to their experiences of completing these surveys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on testers' feedback the following changes were made:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Number the registration steps from 1 -- 3, to provide an obvious flow through
 the registration process (the steps may still be completed in any order
 desired).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stop showing a 
\emph on

 One tester expected a button in this position to advance the survey.
 This change also simplifies the interface.
 (Surveys can still be cancelled by repeatedly tapping the back button to
 return to the first screen, then tapping 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prevent the ESM assessment survey from stopping any music that is playing
 on the device.
 We do this by checking that music is not playing before attempting to measure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Draw evenly-spaced tick marks alongside the ESM assessment feelings item
 sliders.
 Several testers requested this because they were concerned that their answers
 were inconsistent.

\begin_layout Itemize
intrinsic motivation, based on an interest in or enjoyment of the tasks
 associated with participation (this motivation could be intensified by
 the study's novelty and use of new technology);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
altruistic motivation, through assisting research aimed at producing knowledge
 that may ultimately be of social benefit; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
direct personal benefit, in the form of the opportunity for participants
 to learn more about variations in their own wellbeing, and by the somewhat
 game-like nature of participation, in which response occasions, rates and
 times can be tracked and (potentially) compared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We considered whether financial incentives might be provided, but ruled
 these out on two grounds: they would become prohibitively costly if a sample
 of the desired large size was achieved, and they could risk crowding out
 intrinsic and altruistic motivations

To reach potential participants, we intended to rely on word-of-mouth and
 on coverage in traditional and social media.
 Word-of-mouth recruitment would be aided by the fact that the app signals
 participants at random moments, potentially in social contexts where the
 signal might be remarked upon and then explained.

 the form of two prominent links.
 The 'get the app' link takes visitors who are browsing on their iPhone
 directly to App Store, and instructs those on other platforms to search
 the App Store for 'mappiness' (which is the quickest way to download the
 app).
 The 'tell me more' link takes visitors to the More info page.

 The app is filed under the Store's 'Lifestyle' category but, given the
 large number of apps in each category, is more likely to be reached by
 a direct search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mappiness was also displayed in the editorially-driven 'Featured' area of
 the UK App Store for two weeks shortly after launch, and we believe this
 was the source of a large proportion of the large number of downloads during
 this period.
 We had contacted a developer Partnership Manager at Apple UK to make the
 case for such placement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Reviews
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
App users are able to post reviews (free text) and ratings (1 -- 5 stars)
 of apps in the Store.
 For Mappiness, these may influence potential participants' choice to download
 and take part.
 In iOS 3, the user is prompted to rate an app when it is deleted, and this
 can cause a downward bias in app ratings.
 To help counter this, we displayed a message to ongoing users, requesting
 them to give a rating: when participants completed exactly ten ESM assessment
 responses, the message displayed at the top of the main screen of the app
 changed temporarily to 'Like mappiness? Please rate us in the App Store'.
 The app was rated at 4 out of 5 stars throughout most of the research period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
App
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As just noted, the main screen of the app displays a one-line status message
 which is retrieved from the server, alongside current response statistics,
 each time the app is launched.
 This message is used for brief ongoing communication with participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before any ESM assessments have been submitted this messages reads 'If not
 in UK, see our site for timezone info', to try to prevent non-UK participants
 from being caught out by timezone differences.
 When exactly ten responses have been submitted, it requests an App Store
 review, as noted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:app-store"

\end_inset

.
 At all other times, it displays a default message.
 Most commonly, we set this to 'Thank you for taking part', but we occasionally
 varied it with news about the study: for example, a note that we were on
 Twitter, or about media coverage, or a link to a new post on the blog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prospective and registered participants can also contact us by email directly

 As expected, the three quantities are in general highly correlated, with
 spikes that can be traced to items of media coverage.
 The first and largest spike also coincides with being featured in the UK
 App Store for two weeks --- it is thus largely UK-specific, and unusually
 weakly correlated with website visits.

Daily response counts are illustrated in

 Changes in these counts reflect a balance between the recruitment of new

 As expected, therefore, numbers of responses and of responding participants
 increase during periods of major recruitment, as seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Two brief troughs in the response count chart --- from 28 -- 30 August

 which participants were not signalled.

Data quality and cleaning

\begin_layout Standard
In comparison to the checks run on the web survey data, which were discussed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:data-quality"

\end_inset

, relatively little quality checking was applied to the ESM data.
 There are three main reasons for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, ESM study participants are not paid, and have no obvious incentives
 to supply poor quality or inaccurate responses.
 In fact, doing so would invalidate two of the three incentives for participatio
n discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Participant-motivation"

\end_inset

.
 Second, location information is sensed automatically, and cannot therefore
 be easily falsified.
 We therefore do not need to verify location using IP addresses, for example.
 Third, there is rather less scope than in the web survey data for quality
 checking --- there are relatively few response combinations which are impossibl
e, even if some may seem improbable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The checks which we do run are discussed in relation to broader issues of
 response validity in

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we have discussed the design and implementation of our spatial
 ESM data collection technique.
 We developed an app for iPhones (and other Apple iOS devices), and data
 server software to signal to and receive data back from it.
 We prioritised speed and simplicity in the app-based ESM assessments, to
 facilitate recruitment and retention of volunteers.
 We collected a range of data using survey items and the devices' sensors,
 not all of which can be analysed within the scope of this thesis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As already stated, the data collected by this means enables us to examine
 links between EQ and SWB at the highest spatial and temporal resolution.
 And as we discuss further in the final chapter, we believe this methodology
 to have significant potential for further exploitation, in this and many
 other fields.
