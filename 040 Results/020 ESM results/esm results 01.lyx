\begin_layout Chapter
Momentary happiness and the immediate environment
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "chap:esm-results"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter describes and analyses the large panel data set collected using
 the spatial experience sampling methodology detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:esm-research-methods"

\end_inset

, and augmented with objective spatial data using GIS as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:analysis-methods"

\end_inset

.
 We use this data to test the hypothesis that individuals' momentary feelings
 of happiness are positively related to EQ levels in their immediate surrounding
s.
 As indicators of EQ, we focus on land cover characteristics, while controlling
 for daylight and weather conditions.
 We control also for per-individual fixed effects and a large set of contextual
 indicators, including companionship and activity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted previously, we believe both this hypothesis and this method to
 be novel within (and, in part, beyond) the happiness economics literature.
 As discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:analysing-happiness"

\end_inset

, the simple availability of any panel data has been a rarity in this area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:esm-Response-validity"

\end_inset

 describes our criteria for including and excluding data in our analyses.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:esm-Descriptive-results"

\end_inset

 characterises the data that is included, at both participant and response
 level.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:esm-analysis"

\end_inset

 reports on the models we estimate to quantify the relationship between
 happiness and immediate environment, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:esm-discussion"

\end_inset

 discusses our findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All descriptions and analyses reported in this chapter are based on a snapshot
 of our ESM data covering the period of approximately six months from the
 app's launch to 14 February 2011.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Response validity
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:esm-Response-validity"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We describe as 'valid' the subset of response data which we both can include
 and judge should be included in our analyses.
 In subsequent sections the reported figures apply to these valid responses
 only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We exclude duplicate response submissions
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Duplicate submissions occur where data transmission is interrupted after
 the data is received by the server, but before the server's acknowledgement
 of receipt is received by the app, so that the app re-sends at the next
 opportunity.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and responses from the researcher.
 We exclude incomplete responses, and those without GPS location data
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
More sophisticated options for the treatment of missing data, such as multiple
 imputation, are beyond the scope of this study.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We exclude responses from outside the UK, which are identified by the non-avail
ability of LCM data.
 As a simple quality criterion, we exclude responses where more than twelve
 simultaneous activities have been ticked.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Response delay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure a fully random sample of experiences, we would ideally like all
 participants to respond instantaneously to all signals.
 Since this is not realistic, varying judgments have been made in previous
 research regarding the maximum acceptable response delay, as discussed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Missing-and-delayed-data"

\end_inset

.
 The exclusion of a response and the inclusion of a delayed response may
 both compromise the randomness of the sample, so the judgment made represents
 a trade-off between these two evils.

 We choose to exclude responses where the delay is greater than 60 minutes

This is a relatively long allowable delay in relation to what is usual in
 the EMA literature.

Location accuracy and weather data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again in an ideal world, we would like to know the geographical coordinates
 of each outdoor response with absolute precision, and we would like to
 know the weather conditions at that location at the precise moment of respondin
g.
 Again, of course, we must in practice make a trade-off between accuracy
 and exclusion rate.

Participation rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opportunistic recruitment strategy used in this research does not enable
 us to calculate the overall participation rate --- i.e.
 the number of individuals who took part as a proportion of those that had
 the opportunity to do so (which we might define rather broadly as all iPhone
 owners who encountered the app in the App Store, heard about the study
 on the radio or via Twitter, and so on).
 We can, however, investigate the attrition rate between downloading the
 app, registering to take part, and responding to signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Worldwide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Globally, up to the end of 13 February 2011, the app had been downloaded
 43,295 times (according to figures supplied by Apple), and 35,057 registrations
 had been received: approximately 81% of individuals who downloaded the
 app completed the registration process.
 Up to the same moment, one or more signalled responses (though not in all
 cases valid responses) had been received from 29,099 registered apps: hence
 approximately 83% of registering users --- or 67% of downloading users
 --- went on to respond to at least one signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
UK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were 30,053 downloads from the UK App Store up to the end of 13 February.
 Registrations are not geo-located, but we can tell that 73% of those who
 downloaded the app from the UK App Store (21,947 participants) completed
 registration and went on to contribute one or more valid responses.

Some participants have set signalling periods which seem unlikely to span
 the full waking day --- for example, approximately 1% choose to be signalled

 was to keep the burden on participants as low as possible.

In calculating this fraction, we count in the denominator only beeps sent
 to participants we believe were still active at the time of sending.
 We consider a participant to have become inactive immediately after their
 last received response if one or more of these conditions were met when
 the data snapshot was taken: beeps per day was set to zero; the participant's
 device had been reported inactive by Apple; or no responses had been received
 from the participant for at least 14 days.

Means and standard deviations of the Happy, Relaxed and Awake item responses
 are presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:Summary-feelings"

\end_inset

, and their distributions are charted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Distributions-of-feelings"

\end_inset

.
 The three distributions are very similar, and all show the typical peak
 at approximately 70% of the way to the scale's top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each distribution also shows two artefacts of the response process: large
 spikes at the absolute extremes of the distribution, where the response
 slider is moved to its limit, and small troughs on either side of the midpoint,
 where the slider is most commonly either left in its initial position or
 moved a minimum distance to the left or right.
 We check the robustness of our results to excluding the spikes at the extremes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three feelings items show substantial correlation, with coefficients
 of 0.71 for Happy -- Relaxed, 0.41 for Happy -- Awake, and 0.31 for Relaxed
 -- Awake.
 In the rest of this chapter, we consider only the Happy response.

\begin_layout Standard
To help understand the sampling limitations in this study --- regarding
 both participant characteristics and the limits on when participants can
 and will respond to an ESM assessment signal, as discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Reachability-and-response"

\end_inset

 --- we compare our reported activities with those recorded for a random
 population sample in a diary-based study.
 We use UK Time Use Survey 2000 (UKTUS) data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "office-for-national-statistics:2005"

\end_inset

 to estimate approximate figures for comparison.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These UKTUS data list the average number of minutes in each 24-hour (1440-minute
) period that participants spend in different activities.
 Because Mappiness only signals participants during waking hours, we subtract
 the time UKTUS respondents report they spend sleeping from the day length,
 and calculate the percentage of daily waking time (933 minutes) spent by
 UKTUS respondents in each activity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UKTUS responses categorise activities according to a detailed, three-level
 classification, reproduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:uktus-activities-classification"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "sec:uktus-activities-classification"

\end_inset

 of Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:esm-results-appendix"

\end_inset

.
 We do our best to aggregate these categories to recreate the Mappiness
 activity types, but this is not possible at all for some activities, and
 in other cases results in a clearly inexact match.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the UKTUS data concern only what is considered the 'main' activity
 undertaken at any moment, whereas Mappiness asks about all activities without
 prioritisation.
 All other things being equal, we would therefore expect the proportions
 of time spent in each activity in the Mappiness data to be greater than
 in their UKTUS comparator, especially for potentially subsidiary or background
 activities.

.
 In general, the figures appear encouragingly similar.
 Figures differing by more than a factor of two are highlighted in the table,
 and discussed below.
 In general, such differences appear to have plausible (though not provable)
 explanations in terms of the activity definitions and/or disparities in
 demographic profiles.
 Experience sampling issues might also contribute, however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Talking,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

chatting,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

socialising This activity is substantially more prevalent in the Mappiness
 data set (15% vs 6%).
 This may be the result of our inclusion of the very general activity 'talking',
 which has no direct equivalent in the UKTUS classification, and/or the
 fact that socialising might often be considered secondary to a more specific
 activity, and thus not be captured as the UKTUS 'main' activity.

\begin_layout Description

games,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

iPhone
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

games This activity appears over ten times more prevalent amongst our participan
ts than in the UKTUS sample.
 This might reflect: the increasing reach of technology over the ten years
 separating the studies; gaming occurring as a secondary activity, such
 as while travelling; and, of course, the fact that every single one of
 our participants has access to a gaming device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 Given the young and wealthy demographic profile of Mappiness participants,
 this initially appears surprising.

\begin_layout Description
Gardening,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

allotment Unusually, this activity is substantially more common in the UKTUS
 data (1% vs 0.2%).
 This might be linked to the lack of older and retired people in our sample.
 There might also be experience sampling explanations, however: gardeners
 may not be possession of their iPhone; might not hear the signal above
 the noise of garden equipment; or may be unable to respond with dirty hands
 or while wearing gloves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Hunting,
\begin_inset space ~

UKTUS comparator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UKTUS respondents are not asked whom they are with when at work or studying,
 and do not always provide an answer to the question at other times.
 The data are therefore consistent with UKTUS respondents being alone or
 with people they do not know during between 21% and 47% of the waking day
 (calculations based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "office-for-national-statistics:2005a"

\end_inset

), and our data fall well within these bounds.
 The other UKTUS companionship categories cannot be mapped to ours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Device
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Owing to the validity requirements that a signal be pending and a location
 be reported, a much larger proportion of the responses from GPS- and mobile
 Internet-equipped devices (the iPhone 3G, 3GS and 4, and some iPads) are
 valid.
 This difference is even greater outdoors: in this case non-GPS, non-cellular
 devices will rarely be capable of receiving a signal, or have any means
 of estimating location, and the iPhone 3G, 3GS and 4 account for all but
 326 valid responses.
 Complete response counts by device are given in

 As discussed in

We consider land cover, countryside designation status and weather conditions
 only as interactions with being outdoors.
 Although it is possible that these variables are also associated with happiness
 when participants are indoors or in a vehicle, the same direct link from
 environmental exposure to mood cannot be posited with any confidence in
 these cases.
 In addition, when participants are not outdoors their location is less
 accurately determined by GPS, making these spatial data less reliable.

According to LCM data (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Land-cover-map"

\end_inset

), a little over half of outdoor responses come from the continuous urban
 habitat type, and just over a quarter from the suburban/rural developed
 type.
 The seven non-urban types thus account for just under a quarter of outdoor
 responses between them.
 The least frequently observed habitat type outdoors (mountains, moors and
 heathland) accounts for less then 0.5% of outdoor responses, and less than
 0.05% of all responses --- confirming the value of having collected a very
 large data set.
 A full summary is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In the absence of an

 achieved by an ESM study.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Fixed-effects-model"

\end_inset

, we estimate fixed effects models from the ESM data.
 We run three models, each with reported happiness as the dependent variable
 (scaled 0 -- 100).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first model includes only spatial characteristics --- whether the respondent
 is indoors, outdoors or in a vehicle, and land cover and weather when outdoors
 --- as explanatory variables.
 The second model adds control variables from the ESM assessment survey
 --- activity, companionship, and whether the respondent is at home, at
 work or elsewhere --- to the specification.
 Finally, the third model also adds indicators of the day and time, and
 of the position of the response in the contributing participant's response
 sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third model is presented below in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:lcm-model"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest EQ (land cover) impacts on predicted happiness are seen in the
 first model.
 The addition of companionship, activity and location type controls in the
 second model reduces the size of the land cover coefficients by approximately
 a factor of two
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The R
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 statistic also jumps from 0.6% in the first model to 13.1% in the second.
 The reason for the first model's very low R
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

, despite large and significant coefficients on the explanatory variables,
 is the low rate of responses received from outdoor, non-urban locations,
 which was noted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:esm-Spatial-variables-descriptives"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This appears intuitive: for example, the occasions on which people visit
 a park or the countryside may well be associated with leisure activities,
 relaxation and good company.
 Therefore, if we do not control for these factors we are liable to overestimate
 the link with land cover alone.
 Differences between the second model and the third model are much less
 great, although the inclusion of additional controls in the third model
 does again very slightly reduce the land cover coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the remainder of this chapter we focus exclusively on the the third model,
 incorporating the widest range of control variables.
 We refer to this as our main land cover model.

\begin_layout Subsection
Control variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coefficients on control variables in the main land cover model demonstrate
 relationships with reported happiness that are in all cases highly intuitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All effects are, of course, controlled for all others, so results are somewhat
 different than when considering each factor in isolation.
 For example, simple mean happiness on weekdays keeps rising to an evening
 peak, whereas in the model --- after controlling for activity, companionship,
 and other factors --- the happiest period is mid-afternoon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Activity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants' happiest activity, by a large margin, is intimacy or lovemaking.
 Physical exercise, cultural activities (theatre, dance, concert, exhibition,
 museum, library) and creative and performative activities (singing, performing,
 hobbies, arts, crafts) also score very highly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants are notably happy when engaged in various activities that may
 be common in natural environments, including gardening, hunting, fishing,
 hiking and birdwatching.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants are least happy when sick in bed, with a negative coefficient
 more than four times the size of the next greatest.
 Queuing, care-giving, and travelling are also associated with significantly
 reduced happiness, as is the commonest activity in the data set: working
 or studying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, since the activity dummy variables are not mutually exclusive,
 there is no base category in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Companionship
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The companionship dummies are not mutually exclusive, but the implicit base
 category (when all are zero) is 'Alone or with strangers only'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The company of a partner or friend is strongly associated with greater happiness.
 Responses in the presence of other family members are slightly happier
 than those when the participant is alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, responses in the company of colleagues and other acquaintances
 are slightly less happy.
 Happiness when with children, clients or customers is not significantly
 different from happiness when alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All else being equal, participants are significantly less happy during weekday
 early mornings (3am -- 9am) and the very early hours of weekend days (3am
 -- 6am) than at any other time.
 Since we include only signalled responses in our analyses, participants
 responding during these hours presumably expected to be awake.
 Such responses therefore appear more likely to be associated with the demands
 of employment (including shift working) than with being woken by a child,
 for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants are also happier at any time of day during the weekend than
 at the corresponding time during the week.
 
\begin_inset Formula $F$

Sequence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reported happiness on average increases substantially during the course
 of an individual's participation.
 There could be a number of explanations for this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the aim of the study is to observe natural levels of wellbeing,
 and not to influence those levels, regular prompts to report on wellbeing
 might well have some wellbeing effects.
 For example, it may be that taking part in the study leads to increased
 reflection on states of mind and awareness of the factors that affect them,
 enabling participants to act to improve their mood.
 We have received correspondence from participants providing anecdotal support
 for this explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may also be that participants initially respond to signals assiduously,
 irrespective of mood, but in later stages are more inclined to respond
 when feeling good

Location and environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants are happier at home than at work, and happier still when in
 neither location.
 Happiness levels when indoors or in a vehicle are not significantly different,
 but participants are happier than in either when they are outdoors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Weather
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weather variables --- considered only when participants are outdoors ---
 have significant effects on predicted happiness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants are happier when temperatures are higher.
 In particular, a large jump in happiness levels is associated with the
 highest temperature category, 24ºC and above.
 This effect is of a similar magnitude to those of the happiest activities:
 approximately 5 points on the 0 -- 100 happiness scale, or one quarter
 of a standard deviation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slightly greater happiness is also associated with sunshine.
 By contrast, high wind speeds, rain and fog are all linked to somewhat
 lower happiness levels.
 The coefficients on daylight and snow are not significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Land cover
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the regression results bearing directly on our research hypothesi
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
When outdoors, every habitat type except inland bare ground is associated
 with significantly higher happiness levels than continuous urban.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coastal locations are by some distance the happiest, with responses approximatel
y 6 points higher than continuous urban environments on the 0 -- 100 scale.
 Alternatively expressed, this is a difference of 0.28 standard deviations,
 or one of similar magnitude to, for instance, the difference between attending
 an exhibition and doing housework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All other green or natural environment types --- mountains, moors, heathlands,
 woodlands, grasslands, farmland, freshwater, wetlands and flood plains
 --- are between 2.7 and 1.8 points happier than continuous urban environments.
 Suburban or rural developed environments are a little under one point happier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Additivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accounting for the fact that participants are in any case happier outdoors
 than indoors, an additional 2.3 scale points (one tenth of a standard deviation)
 may be added to each land cover coefficient if we wish to compare happiness
 levels outdoors in these higher-EQ environments with levels indoors in
 a continuous urban environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain activities, such as gardening, birdwatching, hunting and fishing,
 may be mainly or exclusively carried on outdoors in green or blue spaces.
 And, of course, people may be more likely to venture into high-EQ outdoor
 environments in pleasant weather.
 Assuming, of course, that our model is correctly specified in its inclusion
 of most variables as independent effects, we may simply add coefficients
 together to compare predicted happiness in such scenarios.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for example, the predicted happiness of a person who is outdoors (+2.32),
 birdwatching (+4.32) with friends (+4.38), in heathland (+2.71), on a hot
 (+5.13) and sunny (+0.46) Sunday early afternoon (+4.30) is approximately
 26 scale points (1.2 standard deviations) higher than that of someone who
 is commuting (

Equivalently, this is a difference of about the same size as between being
 ill in bed (

 same.

status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In future work, we may add an item regarding holidays to the ESM survey
 (alongside other states, such as being drunk, hungover, hungry, or unwell)
 and/or investigate the use of heuristics, including distance from home
 and time since a 'working, studying' response, for identifying probable
 holiday responses.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Because participants may be more likely to visit remote high-EQ environments
 when on holiday, it is possible that the positive happiness effects we
 identify for natural environments could be partly due to such an effect.
 To address this issue we re-estimate the model using only responses received
 on weekends and Bank Holidays, when the great majority of respondents are
 'on holiday' to the extent that they are free to engage in leisure activities.

This restriction reduces the response sample size by about two-thirds.
 Abbreviated estimates from the resulting model are shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:weekends-only-esm"

\end_inset

.
 All LCM type coefficients remain positive.
 Coefficients on all green and blue space types are reduced somewhat in
 magnitude, however, and those on the mountains, moors, heathlands and freshwate
r, wetlands, floodplains types are no longer significantly different from
 zero at the 5% level.
 It is possible that this loss of significance is simply due to the reduction
 in sample size.

\begin_layout Standard
This is by no means a perfect test, but the results would appear to indicate
 that, while the omission of a 'holiday' variable might account for some
 element of the positive EQ results obtained, green and blue space land
 cover types retain substantial positive links with happiness in and of
 themselves.

\begin_layout Standard
As noted in

 we tested the effect of imposing more stringent response validity criteria,
 requiring responses to be made within 20 minutes of a signal instead of
 60 minutes, and reported accuracy to be 100m or better instead of 250m
 or better.

\begin_layout Standard
We estimated a model with the same specification as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 using OLS (in other words, this is our main fixed effects model minus the
 fixed effects).
 The results, which are tabulated in

 of Appendix

\begin_layout Standard
We ran an additional OLS model, also shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:esm-OLS-models"

\end_inset

, including participant-level variables that cannot be included in a fixed
 effects model.
 Again, coefficients on the response-level variables are very similar, while
 those on participant-level variables all conform to expectations from previous
 SWB research: higher incomes and marriage are linked to higher happiness,
 while unemployment, poor health, and long-term illness or disablement predict
 substantially lower happiness reports

The age variables are not significantly different from zero in this OLS

 of happiness with age, with its lowest point at around age 40.

Hypothesis testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, meaningful hypothesis testing requires that the significance level
 be a decreasing function of sample size

\end_inset

, and our sample size is very large.
 In addition, in interpreting our coefficients of interest, we are making
 multiple comparisons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can account for the first issue by using the natural log of the sample
 size as a higher-than-usual critical

 value when testing whether each coefficient is different from zero 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We can account for the second using the Bonferroni correction, dividing
 the significance threshold (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we have reported on the findings of a unique investigation
 into links between EQ in an individual's immediate surroundings and his
 or her momentary happiness reports.
 We rely on data set we have collected from thousands of volunteer participants,
 via their own mobile devices, using a novel spatial experience sampling
 technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even after controlling for many other factors, participants are happier
 outdoors than indoors, and happier when outdoors in any kind of green or
 blue space than when outdoors in continuous urban environments.
 These green and blue spaces are not necessarily remote: urban parks are
 also recognised as such in our data.
 The relationships are highly statistically significant, and their magnitudes
 are substantial.
 The land cover type associated with the greatest happiness is marine and
 coastal margins, suggesting a strong link between immediate happiness and
 this variety of blue space.
\begin_inset Note Note

Or that people enjoy what they do at the beach.
 But is this different?
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings appear robust to various alternative approaches.
 Land cover EQ variables remain significantly linked to happiness when we
 consider only weekend and Bank Holiday responses; exclude the spikes at
 the extremes of the response distribution; increase the stringency of our
 response time and location accuracy criteria for response validity; or
 account for the fact that we are making multiple comparisons using an extremely
 large data set.
 Furthermore, we find positive links of a similar magnitude when we substitute
 high-EQ landscape designation indicators for the land cover indicators
 of EQ.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Causation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know that the relationships we describe are not confounded at the participant
 level --- that is, by associations between types of locations and types
 of people --- because our model is estimated exclusively from the within-indivi
dual variation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Omitted variables (endogeneity issues) remain a possibility, however, in
 this case at the level of experiences.
 Perhaps the likeliest candidates for unobserved characteristics of experience
 are certain temporary ongoing states --- such as holidays, hangovers, or
 short periods of illness --- that may be associated independently with
 changes in both happiness and exposure to EQ.
 Ideally, we might have included additional survey items addressing these.
 On the other hand, our weekends-only model still demonstrates highly significan
t EQ -- SWB associations, and it would seem unlikely that such states are
 responsible for the whole of the effect we report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Causal pathways may well run in both directions, such that people choose
 an environment partly according to their mood, and people's moods are partly
 determined by their environments.
 Although unproven, it seems both plausible and likely that the latter pathway
 --- environment causing mood --- is an important component of the relationship,
 particularly in the light of the findings of experimental/intervention
 studies mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Studies-outside-economics"

\end_inset

.
 Future research might be able to provide greater assurance on this point
 either by identifying exogenous sources of variation in EQ exposure or,
 where the temporal resolution of data is high enough, by careful analysis
 of sequences of change (for example, is it unhappy 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 green space 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 happy, or unhappy 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 green space?).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Generalisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our sample in this research is limited to individuals who have iPhones,
 who encounter the opportunity to participate in the study, and who then
 self-select.
 We therefore did not expect to obtain a sample that is representative of
 the population as a whole and, as seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:esm-Demographics-representativeness"

\end_inset

, we indeed did not.
 Caution is therefore required in making any claims as to the general applicabil
ity of our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know of no particular reason to expect that the demographic peculiarities
 of our sample --- who are younger, richer, and better educated than average
 --- will affect our estimates of relationships between SWB and EQ.
 These differences might mean they are exposed to a somewhat different selection
 of environments, however
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, it might be that our base category urban environments are,
 in fact, nicer than the average, which could lead to an underestimation
 of the positive links with other land cover types.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Self-selection could affect our findings if there are meaningful differentials
 in individuals' sensitivity to the EQ characteristics we examine, and if
 these differentials play a part in individuals' decisions to participate
 in the study.
 We cannot tell how far this restricts the potential to generalise from
 our results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparison with previous findings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since our research methods and hypothesis are novel, comparisons with previous
 research will necessarily be indirect.
 Our findings do appear consistent with the theory and experimental evidence
 outlined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:happiness-and-eq"

\end_inset

, and potentially provide some support for the applicability of the findings
 of experimental studies --- in which a brief exposure to nature improves
 SWB --- to everyday life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hedonic pricing studies such as those by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gibbons:2011a"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "smith:2010"

\end_inset

 have found that EQ of the kind we examine is capitalised in property prices;
 since proximity is likely to facilitate exposure, these positive values
 for nearby EQ seem generally consistent with our findings on happiness
 and immediate experience.
 Effects for specific land cover types are not quite aligned, however: our
 most strongly SWB-predicting type, marine and coastal margins, is not significa
nt in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

's price model, and their most strongly price-predicting type, freshwater,
 wetlands and floodplains, has one of the smallest effects on SWB in our
 model.
 There are many potential explanations for this discrepancy
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, people might be mis-predicting the utility effects of different
 land cover types when making house-buying decisions; different land cover
 types might have genuinely different effects on momentary happiness vs.
 (preference satisfaction) utility; and/or there may be biases from omitted
 variables in either or both studies.
 There could also be specific factors affecting house prices in relation
 to specific land cover types: for example, house prices in marine and coastal
 margin locations might be depressed by flood risk.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most relevant comparators from our web survey research strand, described
 in the previous chapter, are the UK-wide findings.
 These again use the same land cover EQ data we use here, and the comparison
 again shows agreement as to generalities --- some green and blue land cover
 types are positively linked to SWB --- although the specific types do not
 tally.
 We find all of the types that are significant in either the survey-based
 life satisfaction or affective indicator models significant in our ESM-based
 immediate happiness model.
 Again, however, the strongest predictor type for immediate happiness in
 our ESM study, marine and coastal margins, is not significant in either
 of the survey-based models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, this chapter has reported on the application of a novel research
 method to test a new hypothesis in EQ and SWB research.
 This method has significant advantages over the conventional cross-sectional
 survey-based approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are able to gather an extremely large sample, so that even relatively
 small effects may be identifiable.
 The use of satellite positioning (GPS) provides us with accurate and objective
 data on participants' actual locations, including when they are outdoors.
 This allows us to calculate particularly convincing indicators of EQ exposure.
 We use fixed effects to eliminate from our models all individual characteristic
s that are invariant over the period of study --- which may include personality
 characteristics, wealth, and varying interpretations of the subjective
 response scale (the reporting function 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:ps-swb-Subjective-wellbeing"

\end_inset

).
 We can therefore be confident that our results are not confounded by individual
-level factors varying in tandem with home-area EQ.
 Finally, spatial sorting issues are eliminated because we observe individuals
 in a variety of locations with differing EQ.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this method, we find that momentary happiness is positively associated
 with all green and blue space land cover types.
 We believe that this work represents a new and promising line of evidence
 on relationships between SWB and EQ.
