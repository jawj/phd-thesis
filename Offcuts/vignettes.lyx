Anchoring vignettes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Anchoring vignettes are intended to help correct for differential item functioni
ng (DIF) or, equivalently, differing happiness reporting functions across
 individuals.
 Respondents making self-assessments on a scale are asked to assess on the
 same scale each of several hypothetical individuals described by very short
 profiles (the vignettes).
 Answers to the vignette assessments, which have actual (but not reported)
 levels of the variables that are the same for every respondent, are then
 used to adjust the self-assessments, so as to create interpersonally comparable
 measurements.
 The use of anchoring vignettes assumes that respondents use the response
 scale for their self-assessments in the same way that they it for their
 vignette assessments (response consistency), and that the vignettes are
 understood in the same way by all respondents (vignette equivalence)

Vignettes for life satisfaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
For a number of reasons, the use of vignettes for life satisfaction should
 be regarded as somewhat experimental.
 Some have suggested that vignettes be used only for concepts that are unidimens
ional 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "king:2006"

\end_inset

, while life satisfaction is arguably a quantity with many dimensions.
 It could also be argued that the use of vignettes in subjective wellbeing
 research is more fundamentally misconceived: how can a (hypothetical) person's
 
\emph on
subjective
\emph default
 wellbeing be assessed from outside? On the other hand, the self-assessment
 and vignette items used in this study ask about life satisfaction, a wellbeing
 concept that is predominantly cognitive/evaluative---and one which respondents
 could arguably make an educated guess at, given some observable facts.
 If respondents are able to answer vignette questions about life satisfaction,
 their answers may provide valuable information on how they are using the
 response scale for their self-assessments; these outcomes are not certain,
 however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
One existing application of anchoring vignettes to life satisfaction measures
 is known.
 The 2006 wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe
 (SHARE) uses two vignettes to assess life satisfaction of retired people:

Vignette design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Devising a vignette question involves selecting attributes of the hypothetical
 individual to be described, selecting the levels of those attributes, in
 plausible combinations, and then selecting a particular ordering and phrasing
 of these attribute levels within the vignette.
 Since each of these selections is made from an effectively unlimited set
 of possibilities, the process is a significantly subjective and intuitive
 one.

It is potentially also a process which might usefully be guided by qualitative
 research (using focus groups, for example).
 However, there was not time for such research to be carried out within
 the present study.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
To provide the greatest discriminatory power, vignette responses should
 be spaced evenly throughout the distribution of self-assessment responses
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "king:2006"

\end_inset

.
 For example, if using one vignette, the median response should match the
 median self-assessment response; if using a set of four, the median responses
 would ideally fall near the quintiles---the 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th percentil
es---of the self-assessment.
 This cannot be guaranteed in advance, of course, since it is a property
 of the empirical data collected; but existing data on self-assessments,
 and the results of piloting, can help in approaching it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
In this study, it was decided to use four vignettes---which can be used
 create a 9-point DIF-free scale
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\lang british
Those assessing themselves lower than they assess the lowest of the vignettes
 are at the bottom of the scale, at position 1; those assessing themselves
 as tied with the lowest are one step up, at position 2; those assessing
 themselves as between the lowest and second-lowest vignette are at position
 3; and so on.

---and to present these to all respondents.
 The ESS Round 3 data set was used as a guideline for devising vignettes
 with responses at the appropriate levels.
 In this data set, the quintiles of the LS item (B24) responses are at 6,
 7, 8 and 9 on the 0 -- 10 scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
A simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was run, having the LS
 item as the dependent variable, and a number of items that are usually
 significantly associated with LS scores as independent variables.
 These variables included age, age squared, household income, and dummies
 relating to country of residence, gender, marital status, having children,
 health, and social contact.
 The coefficients from this regression were then used to predict LS self-ratings
 for hypothetical individuals with a series of plausible combinations of
 the independent variables (UK resident in every case), and four such combinatio
ns---with predicted self-ratings of approximately 6, 7, 8 and 9---were used
 as the starting point for the four vignettes.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\lang british
This approach to predicting vignette item responses is subject to many limitatio
ns.
 For example, the use of OLS assumes cardinality of responses, which may
 not be justified; none of the independent variables are interacted, although
 it seems probable that the effects on LS ratings of some items are not
 independent; and, most fundamentally, it is not clear that individuals
 will be aware of the normal direction and magnitude of influences on LS.
 However, because the regression was used only as a starting point for the
 vignette items---which were piloted, and in some cases amended on that
 basis---these limitations do not present any problem here.

 suggests excluding age from vignettes, and matching the sex (and cultural
 origin) of the names used in vignettes with those of respondent.
 However, in this case such a strategy was judged to potentially jeopardise
 the comparability of the vignettes presented to different respondents.
 For example, respondents might judge the LS effects of childlessness differentl
y by age and gender, and many occupations and hobbies might draw more attention
 in association with one gender than the other (in the case of a female
 builder, say, or a male netball player).
 Age and gender were therefore fixed for each vignette.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Within genders, it was decided to investigate whether the use of different
 names had any association with LS ratings.
 For three of the vignettes, the name of the hypothetical individual was
 picked at random from a set of four, and presented, again at random, in
 either a full or abbreviated form.
 The set of four names was pre-selected from a list of the top ten names
 given to newborns of the same gender in the UK during the decade of the
 individual's birth (from

).
 For the fourth vignette, the name was picked at random from a set of 15,
 composed of three names each of Arabic, Chinese, Indian, Spanish, and UK
 origin (from
