? At first glance, happiness might seem an unlikely subject of study for
 a dismal science in which, traditionally,

 (Jevons, in

 It could also seem a slightly presumptuous one: does it suggest an attempt
 by economists to colonise not just neighbouring disciplines 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g."

, but the whole search for meaning in life? It might even come across as
 somewhat sinister --- a cold, rational calculus of human emotion could
 recall dystopian visions such as those of Orwell's 
\emph on

\emph default
 or Huxley's 
\emph on

 But it is potentially an intriguing subject too: it almost appears to hold
 out the impossible prospect of an analytical solution to the world's ills.
 And, for economists, it offers a new (or rediscovered) intellectual territory
 where the returns to exploration remain relatively high.

This combination of characteristics has assured happiness economics sustained
 media coverage, certainly out of proportion to the volume of economic research

 All this is in spite of the fact that, to those not familiar with the preferenc

 SWB can sometimes seem underwhelming:

There are many applied papers that report empirical associations between
 happiness and other variables.
 There are rather fewer that treat happiness economics in relation to its
 origins, definitions, theory, methods, applications, critiques, relations
 with other areas of economic research, political and policy connections,

 Absent any disciplinary affiliation, there is a range of ideas that I might

 A useful typology, distinguishing five broad accounts of wellbeing, is
 offered by

 Their five accounts are: (1) 
\emph on
preference satisfaction

, in which wellbeing consists in the freedom and resources to meet one's
 own wants and desires; (2) 
\emph on
objective lists 
\emph default
(or 
\emph on
basic needs

), in which wellbeing is the fulfilment of a fixed set of material, psychologica
l and social needs, which are identified exogenously; (3) 
\emph on
flourishing
\emph default
 (or 
\emph on
eudaimonic
\emph default
), in which well-being means the realisation of one's potential, along dimension
s such as autonomy, personal growth, or positive relatedness 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

; (4) 
\emph on
hedonic

 predominance of positive moods and feelings; and (5) 
\emph on
evaluative

 according to some positive criterion.

Preference satisfaction and subjective wellbeing

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Orthodox, neo-classical economics relies overwhelmingly on the preference
 satisfaction (PS) account of wellbeing.
 The new (and perhaps still somewhat heterodox) happiness economics concerns
 itself predominantly with the evaluative account, and to some extent with
 the hedonic account, generally lumping these two together under the banner
 of 'subjective wellbeing' (SWB).
 These two principal approaches to happiness in contemporary economics ---
 PS and SWB --- do share certain core premises.
 In particular, they both generally reject external criteria or judgements,
 privileging the individual as the only one qualified to assess his or her
 own wellbeing (this allowing both of them potential compatibility with
 both egalitarian and libertarian political views).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is much that differentiates them, however.
 In fact, it is possible to sketch the development over time of each approach
 as motivated by perceived shortcomings of the other.
 Several authors point to 'paradoxes' and 'revolutions' in this process
 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 First, the neo-classical (PS) project is born at least partly out of dissatisfa
ction with the strongly hedonic flavour of late nineteenth-century economics.
 The cardinalist and utilitarian ideas of those such as Bentham, Mill, and
 later Edgeworth

 are challenged by others, including Jevons, Pareto, and later Robbins,
 for whom inter-personal comparisons of happiness are impossible, and for
 whom neither psychology nor ethics belong within a positivist economic
 science (

LatexCommand citealp
key "sen:2008"

).
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The hedonic and utilitarian economics of the late nineteenth century can
 in itself be understood partly as a reaction to the classical political
 economy of those such as Smith, Ricardo and Malthus.
 Their work is not expressed in the language of (or equipped with the methods
 now associated with) PS.
 But it is nonetheless concerned primarily with income, wealth and material
 needs --- understandably, at a time when these were more pressing problems
 for more people than they are today in what is now the developed world
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pasinetti:2006"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Later, deficiencies of the PS account and its associated methods spur a
 'counter-revolution': the rediscovery within economics of SWB accounts,
 by Easterlin (whose 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "easterlin:1974"

\end_inset

 paper is often cited as a beginning of this process), the 'Leyden school'
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:who-Others"

\end_inset

), and others.
 Differing judgements as to the meaningfulness and inter-personal comparability
 of subjective self-ratings of wellbeing are thus at the heart of the distinctio
n between the PS and SWB approaches.
 Out of these, each approach has developed its own apparatus of methods,
 theories and assumptions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Preference satisfaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In its strictest form the PS approach, since it steers clear of subjective
 data and rules out interpersonal comparisons, is left with a limited number
 of interesting things to say directly regarding happiness, or its closest
 available synonym, utility.
 In utility theory, utility is only an index, an analytically instrumental
 quantity, which individuals need not be assumed to experience or understand.
 Assuming only that individuals' preferences conform to the axioms of completene
ss, transitivity, reflexivity and continuity, and that they always choose
 their most preferred option, then individuals will behave 
\emph on
as if
\emph default
 they are maximising utility, and their behaviour can be modelled and analysed
 as such.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In respect of the axioms of consumer preference: 
\emph on
completeness
\emph default
 means that for any two options or 'bundles', an individual must prefer
 one or the other, or be indifferent; 
\emph on
transitivity
\emph default
 means that --- for options A, B and C --- if the individual prefers A to
 B and B to C, he or she must also prefer A to C; and 
\emph on
reflexivity
\emph default
 means that if A and B are the same, then the individual must be indifferent
 between them.
 These three axioms define economic rationality.
 To produce defined and 'well-behaved' utility functions, we may also assume:
 
\emph on
continuity
\emph default
, such that if A is preferred to B then things that are sufficiently close
 to A will also be preferred to B; 
\emph on
non-satiation
\emph default
, such that having more of A is always preferred, however slightly, to having
 less; and 
\emph on
strict convexity
\emph default
, such that some balance of items X and Y is preferred to an extreme quantity
 of either.
 A fuller treatment of consumer preference and utility theory can be found
 in any microeconomics textbook.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The set of choices an individual can make is understood to be constrained
 by his or her budget and, assuming non-satiation, a larger budget always
 implies that more highly preferred options can be chosen.
 It then follows that utility will be increasing in income: for utility

\begin_layout Plain Layout
*** on the one hand, SWB theory is not of the same kind as PS theory: it's
 essentially about measurement and modelling, and rather agnostic as to
 the causes of happiness; whereas PS is predicated on the basis of measurement
 being impossible, and confines itself to considering income and the consumer
 choices income creates ***
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
*** on the other hand, the basics are rather similar; rather than saying
 'all other things being equal' as in PS, in SWB we just dump the other
 things in our utility/happiness function; wrap it in a reporting function;
 and proceed to estimate s empirically *** 
\end_layout

\end_inset

The empirical SWB literature often leaves its theoretical base largely unstated.
 The premises are also straightforward, though.
 The fundamental distinction from PS is the conviction that there is a quantity,
 'happiness', that individuals experience and that can be measured and modelled
 directly.
 SWB research thus throws any and every potential influence on happiness
 into a function together, wraps this in a reporting function, and proceeds
 to estimate parameters empirically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implicitly, then, there is a mental quantity representing experienced happiness,
 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, which is explicable by a vector of characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, and can be evaluated and reported as a quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $h=H(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r=R(h)$
\end_inset

.
 To be a useful insight into 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, the form of the reporting function 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 must satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $R'>0$
\end_inset

 or at least 
\begin_inset Formula $R'\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 Usually, both 
\begin_inset Formula $H(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 must be the same across individuals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "senik:2005"

\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 must also be assumed independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 except as mediated by 
\begin_inset Formula $H(\cdot)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various further assumptions are necessary according to the method of analysis.
 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is generally bounded between a lower and upper limit and, depending on
 our precise SWB concept, may in fact represent a series of psychological
 processes including recollection and aggregation of experiences through
 time; it is generally assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $R(H(\mathbf{x}))$
\end_inset

 can be modelled as a linear or log-linear function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

; analysis of panel data assumes stability of 
\begin_inset Formula $H(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 over time; use of OLS, or of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 values averaged across individuals, assumes cardinality; and so on.
 The assumptions required by different methods of analysis are discussed
 further in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 can be include just about anything, but economists have been especially
 interested in relative income parameters (both time-lagged and peer incomes:
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i,t}-y_{i,t-1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}-\bar{y}$
\end_inset

) and macroeconomic variables, including unemployment, inflation, and governance.
 Most of the happiness research published in mainstream economics journals
 to date has concerned itself with these explanatory factors, but there
 is perhaps increasing interest in other influences, such as indicators
 of social and environmental capital.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no easy mapping between the PS concept of utility and SWB measures
 of happiness.
 Neither is defined explicitly; each is a black box, only truly comprehensible
 to the individual concerned --- if even to them --- and then perhaps only
 tacitly.
 Utility is whatever individuals (prospectively) behave as if to maximise;
 SWB is whatever individuals understand by the question they are asked,
 used (generally retrospectively) as a guide to recollecting, filtering,
 aggregating and reporting their experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intuitively, some understanding of happiness probably is what most people
 are trying to maximise, and SWB measures are sometimes described as measures
 of 'experienced' utility, in contrast to the expected or 'decision' utility
 yielded by the PS approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kahneman:1997,kahneman:2005"

\end_inset

.
 But while this does capture a useful distinction between the two quantities,
 it would be misleading to portray them, as this terminology might imply,
 as simply prospective and retrospective versions of an equivalent metric.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Studies of happiness have also used data based on reports by others (the
 subjects' friends or colleagues, or mental health professionals, for example)
 and on subjects' observed behaviour (such as smiling, or even suicide attempts).
 Whether these measures constitute 
\emph on
subjective 
\emph default
wellbeing data is debatable.
 On the one hand, they are certainly not objective data as understood within
 a strict objective list or preference satisfaction approach---for example,
 data on suicide attempts would not be relevant under these approaches to
 wellbeing, since suicide may be attempted by people who are objectively
 well provided for, and well able to satisfy their consumption preferences.
 On the other, they are clearly not subjective in the sense of data arising
 more or less directly from subjects' experiences and perceptions of their
 own mental states --- even if they may still be powerful indicators of
 those experiences and perceptions.

 approaches to wellbeing and happiness.
 But SWB is not a monolithic concept; it is itself an umbrella term for
 a number of distinct ways of conceiving of a person's wellbeing.
 Many different survey questions have been taken as measuring SWB in the
 literature to date: the World Database of Happiness catalogues over a thousand
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 These questions differ in a number of respects, including the breadth and
 timescale of experience encompassed, and the words in which the idea of
 wellbeing is expressed (which have included, for example: happiness; satisfacti
on with one's life situation, with life as a whole, or with quality of life;
 enjoyment of life; contentment; and many other variants).

 Empirically, studies asking different questions have produced results that
 are generally fairly consistent with each other.
 But the use of different questions does make comparison of findings between
 studies problematic: it is difficult to be sure that any differences are
 not simply the result of nuances in the terms (and therefore concepts)
 in the questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Communication and policy considerations may be one reason for the use of
 different terms, and the terminology used in reporting research may not
 match that used in the research itself.
 For example, a New Economics Foundation policy workshop identified

confusion/conflation with happiness

 as a threat to the use of wellbeing in policy

\end_inset

 even though in the report of this same workshop those terms are used interchang
eably and without clarification.
 On the other hand, 'happiness' seems to be used more widely than 'wellbeing'
 in media reporting of SWB research.
 Hence a study that actually asked respondents about 'life satisfaction'
 may be reported in the media as dealing with 'happiness' and to policy-makers
 as a 'wellbeing' study.

It seems possible, too, that economists have not wished to dwell on the
 variety of related but distinct wellbeing ideas because to do so would
 cast doubt on the potential for any one of them to represent a proxy for
 decision utility --- the thing that individuals seek to maximise --- and
 hence on the validity of their use for monetary valuation (see

SWB can be measured using either single- or multiple-item scales.
 Multiple-item scales pose the question whether and how to aggregate the
 individual items.
 Some multiple-item scales focus purely on the evaluative aspects of SWB,
 asking about satisfaction in different life domains (work, relationships,
 finances, and so on ---

So far, research within economics has tended overwhelmingly to focus on
 single-item measures.
 On a pragmatic level, single-item measures have good data availability:
 they are included in several major surveys.
 Analysing a unitary quantity of something utility-like is familiar economic
 territory, and makes monetary valuation straightforward.
 And use of a single-item scale may be justified by the contention that
 the individual concerned is best placed to aggregate all the different
 aspects of his or her own wellbeing.
 On the other hand, single-item measures have poorer reliability

Regardless of the terminology used and the timescale asked about, what a

 Random variation between different individuals' interpretations --- as

 source of measurement error.
 The extent of this error may depend partly on the choice of terms, since
 some appear more capable of multiple interpretations than others (the word

Non-random variation in interpretations represents a more serious challenge

Given ratings' subjectivity, it is arguably impossible to determine how

 However, different interpretation and reporting styles seem likely to be

 While there may be some simple, universal concepts, 'happy', 'satisfied'
 and 'wellbeing' are probably not among them; for example, 'happy' appears
 weaker in meaning than straightforward translations in some other European

 response rates well short of 100%.
 Those who do not respond may be different in ways that are important for
 our understanding of SWB, at least at the population level.
 In the notation used above, the probability of even observing

 For example, it is plausible that depressed people would be less likely
 to participate in social research, and that standard telephone and face-to-face
 survey methods might well attract respondents who are unrepresentatively

 highly with SWB ratings.

The techniques used to estimate a particular model from the data depend
 on three factors.
 First, what questions are to be addressed? Economists are usually interested
 in determining whether and how much particular factors affect SWB --- commonly
 with a special focus on income measures and (un)employment, while controlling
 for other impacts.
 Second, what data sets are available? Are these at the micro (individual)
 level, or aggregated (for example, by country); do they comprise cross-sectiona
l, time-series, or panel data; what SWB items are included, what scales
 are the responses given on, and what other data is available for analysis?
 Third, and finally, what assumptions can reasonably be made regarding the
 SWB variables and the explanatory variables (both observed and unobserved)?

Ordinal SWB comparability

\begin_layout Standard
Relaxing the assumption of cardinality and turning to ordinal comparability,
 A2, many researchers have used the standard ordered probit and logit models.
 These models treat ordinal data (
\begin_inset Formula $r=1\ldots J$
\end_inset

) as the discrete expression of a continuous latent variable of arbitrary
 scale.
 On this basis they estimate two sets of parameters using maximum likelihood:
 first, a coefficient vector used to predict the latent variable from the
 explanatory variable vector (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

); and second, a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $J-1$
\end_inset

 cut-points, which are the values of the latent variable where there is
 a change in the observed discrete rating.

 note that the standard ordered logit and probit models implicitly cardinalise

 on this basis suggest a method they term probit OLS or probit-adapted OLS.
 The probit-adapted OLS is a simple OLS model using a 'rough cardinalisation'
 of the ordinal SWB variable: a transformation such that the new dependent
 variable takes the conditional mean (given the original ordinal rating)
 of a standardised normally-distributed continuous variable, calculated
 based on the frequencies of the ordinal ratings in the sample (

 Explanatory variables are generally entered into models in a linear specificati

 forms).
 Most researchers have also assumed the effects of different explanatory
 variables to be independent, and potential interactions have not been widely

 --- children be partly contingent on age and gender?).

 Relevant spatial models could include: spatial explanatory variables models
 (in which a person's SWB is correlated with other observed characteristics
 of nearby individuals); spatial error models (in which SWB is correlated
 with unobserved characteristics of nearby individuals); spatial lag models
 (in which SWB is correlated with the SWB of nearby individuals); and models
 accounting for spatial heterogeneity in the relationships between variables.
 The lack of use of spatial models in economic SWB research to date may
 be at least partly explained by the relative scarcity of data that are
 spatially referenced at an appropriately high resolution.
 Spatial models could also be applied to relations in conceptual spaces,
 such as social networks (where by 'nearby', one means 'well known' or 'strongly
 related'), as they have begun to be in the medical literature

 Happiness and wellbeing are such all-encompassing ideas that it is often

 variable is not a cause of happiness (leading to omitted variables bias);
 or even that an

 And individual-level data sets, which have usually not been collected specifica

 be expected to have a significant impact --- such as personality indicators,
 childhood experiences, traumatic events, or being in a relationship (even
 if unmarried) --- and which might not be independent of the variables that
 are the focus of the investigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fixed effects treatments with panel data can of course help with some of
 these factors --- for example, genetic elements of SWB are fixed by definition,
 and other personality traits can be reasonably assumed to be broadly stable
 --- but even with panel data, omitted time-variant variables may be a problem.

 exercise, the proposed payment mechanism, and so on).
 Stated preference studies may also be very costly to run.
 Hedonic pricing --- a common revealed preference method --- relies on the
 assumption that labour and housing markets are in equilibrium, and hence
 that these markets are unrestricted; that there is a wide variety of houses
 and jobs; that individuals know the relevant characteristics of all locations;
 that prices adjust immediately; and that transacting and moving are costless.
 These assumptions are unlikely to be fully met.

Valuation with SWB data does not suffer from these specific weaknesses.
 On the other hand, the method requires strong assumptions of its own.
 Crucially, as noted above, we must accept some particular SWB indicator
 as a proxy for PS-style underlying utility.
 As noted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 We must be persuaded that the SWB regression model takes the correct functional

 air pollution, it may be that less pollution-sensitive individuals live
 in more polluted locations (and vice versa), leading to underestimation

 utility, on the other.

The more radical end of the SWB and consumption literature, drawing on work
 from psychology, suggests that the economic and social system in developed
 economies is partly predicated on a level of structural or manufactured
 dissatisfaction, in more-or-less direct opposition to SWB.
 Such dissatisfaction, in which advertising plays an important role, helps
 to ensure that people remain motivated to consume (e.g.

The impact of income measures on SWB has, as stated above, been a major

 This may be due in part to the centrality of the income/SWB relationship
 when using SWB data for monetary valuation.
 Researchers have investigated absolute income, income relative to others',
 and income relative to past income.

\begin_layout Standard
In general, absolute income is found to have a significant and positive
 association with individuals' SWB, but one whose magnitude is dwarfed by
 the effects of other factors (such as health, labour market status and
 marital status), at least in developed countries.
 There is perhaps surprisingly little discussion in the literature regarding
 the appropriate measure(s) of absolute income: this could be individual
 income, household income, or equivalised household income (adjusted for
 household size and composition).
 
\end_layout

 use a log income measure as the explanatory variable; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
The relatively small effect of absolute income measures on happiness has
 been one of the more interesting findings in the literature and --- given
 the emphasis placed on income in the standard economic account of wellbeing
 as preference satisfaction --- one that has seemed to demand explanation.
 One line of reasoning is that consumption is ultimately the quantity of
 interest under the preference satisfaction approach, and that reported
 income is a noisy and biased proxy, excluding goods provided by the State
 and deferred consumption via savings

 It is generally assumed that this effect is caused by status concerns,

Implications

\begin_layout Standard
Income habituation and (if individuals make social comparisons primarily
 within their own countries) rivalry both help to explain the Easterlin
 Paradox --- that, although individuals' incomes in cross-sectional studies
 are positively related to their SWB, for many countries there appears to
 be no corresponding effect of rising GDP on average national happiness
 figures over time.
 They also suggest that economic growth is of rather less importance than
 economists have traditionally assumed (but this is a contested issue ---
 e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Rivalry implies that visible consumption imposes a negative externality
 on others, while unanticipated habituation to income implies that people
 will choose to work more and take less leisure than would be rational for
 them.
 Both of these effects could inspire corrective taxation policies (

\begin_layout Paragraph
Personal and demographic characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good psychological and physical health both have a strong, positive effect
 on SWB, in line with intuition.
 Almost all studies find a U-shaped relationship between age and SWB, with
 the young and old being happiest.
 Where a gender difference is detected, women usually report slightly higher
 happiness.
 In the US, whites have on average higher SWB than African Americans.
 The impact of education varies between studies: in some it has no significant
 effect, while in others highest SWB is variously associated with lower,
 higher, and intermediate levels of education.
 Marriage and stable partnerships are highly positive for SWB (though the
 potential for omitted variables bias is large here); separation, divorce
 and widowhood are highly negative.
 Parental divorce is found in some (but not all) studies to reduce children's
 SWB in adulthood.
 Evidence on the effect on parents of having children is rather mixed, depending
 on the SWB measure, country, number and age of children, and parental situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Work and time use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unemployment has one of the largest negative impacts on SWB, independent
 of and larger than the associated material loss, reducing reported happiness
 by 5--15% (where scale cardinality is assumed).
 Evidence regarding the effects of different types and hours of employment
 is scarce and somewhat mixed.
 Commuting to work is associated with lower SWB levels, all other things
 being equal.
 Informal care-giving has a negative effect on SWB.
 Community involvement and volunteering may have a positive effect, but
 this finding is somewhat variable (depending on what is controlled for,
 and whether fixed effects are included).
 There is evidence, albeit somewhat limited, that physical activity promotes
 SWB.
 Finally, socialising and regularly attending church are both associated
 with higher SWB, while TV viewing goes with lower SWB

Attitudes and beliefs

\begin_layout Standard
Trust in 'most people', in the people in one's neighbourhood, and in institution
s such as the police and government are all positive predictors of SWB (although
 great caution is required when regressing subjective variables on other
 subjective variables).
 Religious beliefs are generally associated with higher SWB too.
 Political views have not been widely studied, but may affect the impacts
 of other circumstances, including which party is in power 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tella:2005"

 Satisfaction in specific life domains tends to correlate positively with
 global SWB, and may partly or entirely mediate the effect of objective
 circumstances.

Economic and political environment

High unemployment rates may reduce SWB, although research is limited (high
 local unemployment rates may also ameliorate the impact of an individual's
 own unemployment, however).
 Inflation may also have a negative influence on SWB, especially for those
 with right wing politics.
 Democracy, and particularly direct or participative democratic systems,
 may be positive for SWB.
 Evidence on income inequality is very mixed; its effect may depend partly
 on real or perceived mobility.
 There is little evidence concerning the effects of social insurance and
 the welfare state.

Natural and immediate environment

Living in an unsafe or deprived area is, unsurprisingly, detrimental to
 SWB.
 Living in public housing may be negative for SWB 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, but other aspects of housing quality seem to be little studied.
 Living in large cities appears unfavourable, while rural living has a positive
 impact in SWB terms (at least once lower rural incomes are controlled for).
 The evidence of environmental quality effects is still very limited, although
 several studies find a negative impact of air pollution on SWB.
 Some studies also find a link between climate and SWB, such that more extreme
 climates are detrimental.

The variation in SWB explained by all observed factors is well below 50%

As with all heritability measures, however, this figure is as much dependent

 In practice, these objections are easily dismissed: the 'utility monster'

st ethical theory, concerned only with the outcomes of actions, and therefore
 fails to place off-limits actions which are widely held to be wrong.
 But this criticism is of a straw man.
 In practice, there is no reason why the consideration of likely happiness
 outcomes in relation to policy should be accompanied by the jettisoning
 of all ethical rules, including deontological ideas about what is inherently
 right or wrong.
 Maximising happiness is no more sinister than maximising income or any
 other quantity; it is only that the most relevant rule-based constraints
 on our means of doing so may not be the same for every maximand.

 However, as also noted in that subsection, the problem of adaptation ---

Finally, partisan political objections are made: generally, in relation
 to government interest in SWB; and specifically, in relation to supposed
 policy implications of some of the findings of SWB research.
 In the general case it is sometimes argued, along classic liberal lines,
 that making people happy is not a legitimate role of government, which
 should confine itself to the protection of property rights and prevention
 of harm:

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the recent surge in interest in the economics of happiness, it is
 still a relatively young area, with substantial scope for further research:
 either answering new questions, or providing better answers to existing
 questions.
 These could be questions about the impacts of different factors on individuals'
 SWB; questions about SWB itself; or questions which SWB can help to answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Questions about what affects SWB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of the factors already identified as influential on SWB could benefit
 from further research, especially research using data collected for the
 purpose: the secondary data sets used in many analyses lack detail on some
 of the most important determinants of SWB.
 For example, there still appears to be scope for research into income and
 consumption effects on SWB --- including measures of these relative to
 different reference groups --- and into the extents of rivalry and habituation
 in respect of different kinds of consumption (and of other activities).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A focus on how different factors interact would also help in producing a
 more complete and nuanced picture of the factors affecting SWB.
 For example, how do age or education or political, religious or environmental
 views mediate the impacts of other variables and life events? Models here
 include 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "finkelstein:2008a"

\end_inset

, who examine the impact of health status on the marginal utility of income,
 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "clark:2005a"

\end_inset

, who estimate different SWB functions for different classes of individuals
 emerging from their data.
 In addition, studies might usefully deal more explicitly with factors among
 which there is substantial multicolinearity, such as income, education,
 and health.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Questions about SWB itself
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As regards SWB itself, the temporal dimension has been relatively little
 studied in the economic literature to date, but is important for the interpreta
tion and use of SWB data.
 Greater use of ESM/EMA and DRM could help in developing a better understanding
 of how SWB varies hour by hour or day by day.
 For example, individuals are commonly asked for SWB evaluations in the
 ill-defined general present ('nowadays', 'these days', etc.).
 What is the effect of past SWB (and past factors which affected it) on
 such evaluations? And, perhaps more challengingly, what is the influence
 of expectations regarding future SWB and future causal factors (income,
 marital status, environmental quality and so on)? 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "praag:2004a"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "senik:2008"

\end_inset

 provide a first glimpse at these issues.
 These methods could also provide rich and credible data sets for use in
 various other kinds of analyses, such as examining the effects of different
 health states on wellbeing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "dolan:2008a"

, or linking wellbeing measures to choice behaviour 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spatial dimension of SWB also appears somewhat neglected.
 Spatial techniques used in other disciplines and other areas of economics
 (such as hedonic pricing studies) might valuably be applied to SWB data
 (to date, only 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "stanca:2010"

\end_inset

 reports the use of such methods).
 The social dimension of SWB is also a promising area, potentially using
 the same spatial methods (since proximity in social network terms can provide
 alternative conceptions of space, distance and neighbourhood).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "fowler:2008"

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 appear to provide the only published research on this topic so far (and
 are not working within economics); they relate SWB to social proximity
 as measured in a long-term longitudinal medical study and using the social
 networking site Facebook.

\begin_layout Standard
The economics of happiness or SWB is a relatively new field within the disciplin
e (albeit one with clear antecedents), and it continues to expand and mature.
 Having arisen at the edges of several other research areas, increasingly
 it has a momentum of its own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While there can be no formal proof that one person's happiness is comparable
 to another's, a large body of evidence now indicates that such an assumption
 can be both reasonable and useful.
 Meanwhile, the application of increasingly sophisticated econometrics has
 ensured that the additional assumptions required for the analysis of SWB
 data become progressively less restrictive.
 The assumptions implicit in some empirical work, especially with cross-sectiona
l and cross-cultural data, can still be problematic, however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SWB research suggests --- in line with intuition, but not always with the
 emphasis of recent economic literature --- that absolute income is only
 one of a wide range of factors with important implications for human welfare.
 SWB approaches can complement existing approaches to certain economic questions
, such as non-market valuation, where both their strengths and their weaknesses
 are different.
 It also opens some new question to potential investigation.
 In respect of pubic policy, it is of particular value in informing debate
 around the desirability and feasibility of continuing economic growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scope remains for new research at many levels --- theoretical, methodological,
 and empirical --- in the economics of SWB.
 Temporal, spatial and social dimensions seem especially ripe for future
 investigation.
