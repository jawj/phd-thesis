\begin_layout Chapter
Literature review: happiness and environmental quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Why might happiness and EQ be linked?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define environmental quality (EQ) broadly as the presence of environmental
 goods --- such as natural landscapes, scenic views, preferred climates,
 or biodiversity --- and the absence of environmental 'bads', such as air
 pollution or noise.
 Looking beyond economics, there are at least three broad reasons for hypothesis
ing that EQ might be positively related to SWB.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Habitats, psychology & evolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hypotheses regarding the landscapes or habitats considered to be environmental
 goods --- for example, what is it that makes a scenic view scenic? ---
 are generally of a (proximately) psychological and (ultimately) evolutionary
 kind.
 Such hypotheses, of which 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hartig:2010"

\end_inset

 provide a survey, try to explain how selective pressures have shaped the
 human mind so that is attracted to particular habitats or habitat characteristi
cs.
 Although evolutionary hypotheses are rarely testable, they can provide
 helpful starting points for empirical research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several authors have posited an innate human emotional affiliation to nature
 and other living organisms in general, for which 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kellert:1993"

\end_inset

 popularised the term 
\emph on
biophilia
\emph default
.
 This affiliation is proposed as an adaptation to our reliance on the natural
 environment throughout all but the past 10,000 years of our history.
 Affinities with more specific habitats, including savanna and forest, have
 similarly been postulated on the basis that these habitats would have provided
 our hominin ancestors with the greatest reproductive success 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "orians:1980,falk:2010,han:2007"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Preferences for certain characteristics of natural habitats have also been
 conjectured: for example, the availability of locations from which one
 may see but not be seen, enabling one to attain goals while evading hazards
 ('Prospect-Refuge' theory), or the ease with which spatial information
 can be acquired and processed, facilitating understanding and exploration
 of the environment (the 'mystery/complexity/legibility/coherence' model)
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "appleton:1975,kaplan:1989,stamps:2004,hartig:2010"

\end_inset

.
 Yet more abstractly, preferences have been suggested over shapes or patterns
 characteristic of natural scenes, such as specific fractal dimensions,
 energy levels at certain spatial frequencies, or ratios of colour contrast
 to luminance contrast 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "aks:1996,juricevic:2010"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, the positive effects of natural environments could be recast
 as an absence of the negative effects of non-natural, urban environments.
 Urban environments may have negative impacts owing to the high levels of
 arousal, stress, or directed attention they engender or require 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ulrich:1991"

\end_inset

.
 According to Kaplan's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar

\end_inset

 'Attention Restoration Theory' and Ulrich's broader 'psycho-evolutionary
 theory' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ulrich:1991"

\end_inset

 the lack of these factors in natural environments --- as well as the presence
 of certain other characteristics --- permits stress recovery and the restoratio
n of attentional capacity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Environmental 'bads', physical & mental health
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Urban environments may also have a detrimental effect because of higher
 levels of certain environmental 'bads', which in turn could affect happiness
 via significant and direct impacts on physical and/or mental health.

Adverse health effects of noise and air pollution are well documented.

, this link does not require that individuals are conscious of the causal
 relationship between an environmental problem and their own happiness.
 However, awareness of a local environmental problem, and of its negative
 effects on human and ecosystem health, could also act to reduce happiness
 levels directly and independently.
 There is evidence that individuals' perceptions of air pollution are positively
 correlated with objective pollution measures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "day:2007"

\end_inset

 Individuals are generally aware of the sources of pollution (principally,
 main roads), of its fluctuation according to weather conditions, and of
 the negative health effects with which it is associated, especially for
 children 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
Most studies report beneficial impacts of natural environments on health
 or wellbeing, but they have some common weaknesses.
 Observational studies measure domestic proximity to natural environments
 but rarely look at actual experiences of such environments (which may not
 occur near home, and may occur elsewhere); cannot provide data on the moment-by
-moment hedonic or affective element of wellbeing; and are reliant on retrospect
ive assessments that are subject to substantial recall bias

 countries that might be correlated with pollution emissions).

 Although this has the advantage that unobserved heterogeneity across individual
s is evened out, it means that SWB and EQ levels are assessed only on an
 extremely aggregated scale --- with no indication of variability or of
 actual EQ exposures --- and that unobserved heterogeneity across countries,
 including linguistic and cultural heterogeneity, then has to be controlled

 It also requires a cardinal interpretation of SWB responses (though in
 practice, as discussed in

Individual-level studies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remaining papers use individual-level SWB data, controlling for various
 demographic, socio-economic and attitudinal variables in addition to indicators
 of EQ near respondents' homes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A major limitation of most of these studies remains the level of spatial
 aggregation of EQ measures, which are rarely at better (and frequently
 at worse) than electoral ward level.
 The use of such spatially aggregated statistics leads to reduced accuracy,
 to an extent which may be problematic in the case of characteristics varying
 over short distances, such as noise or air pollution

 However, their indicators of air pollution, which may vary over very short

 It also raises the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP): it could be that
 substantially different results would have been obtained if measurements
 had been aggregated across different spatial units

\begin_layout Standard
Even where EQ near the home is estimated accurately, that quantity may itself
 not correspond closely to an individual's actual exposure to or experience
 of EQ.
 For example, exposure in or near the home to certain kinds of air pollution
 may account for only a small fraction of the total variation in exposure

\begin_layout Standard
In common with studies in other disciplines, those in economics have commonly
 focused on only a single EQ parameter (e.g.
 noise), despite probable correlations of that parameter with other EQ and
 broader spatial characteristics (e.g.
 air pollution, land cover type, transport amenities)

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This omission of a broader range of spatial variables in general seems
 liable to lead to endogeneity.
 Furthermore, since EQ differentials may be compensated by wages and house
 prices, differing approaches regarding the inclusion of income and house
 price data mean that different studies turn out to be measuring different
 things (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of the studies addresses the potential influence on SWB of green space,
 such as grassland or forest, despite the evidence from other disciplines
 that green space has a positive wellbeing effect.

 --- while those that have (

Aims of this research
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having reflected on previous research both in happiness economics in general
 and into the relationship of happiness to EQ, the new research described
 in the remainder of this thesis has two strands.
 Both strands involve substantial new primary data collection.
 Both seek to test the hypothesis that EQ characteristics are significantly
 related to individuals' SWB, and to measure the extent of these relationships,
 in some cases in monetary terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first strand builds directly on previous EQ research in happiness economics,
 linking recalled happiness assessments to respondents' usual environments,
 and improving on this in a number of areas.
 The second strand updates the ESM protocol to facilitate very large sample
 sizes, and to incorporate satellite positioning (GPS) location data that
 can be used within a GIS to estimate objective indicators of EQ.
 The first strand is largely evolutionary, while the second is a little
 more revolutionary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time is not the researcher's friend.
 The second strand is reliant on consumer technology that became available
 only after the research had started, and has potential for exploitation
 enormously beyond what has been possible within the constraints of the
 doctorate.
 Meanwhile the first strand, having been conceived of several years ago,
 has in certain respects been overtaken by developments elsewhere.
 Nevertheless, both strands still offer some significant advances on earlier
 research in this field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Recalled happiness and usual environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this strand of research we design, implement, and collect and analyse
 data from two new cross-sectional surveys.
 The first survey was completed by a quota sample of approximately 1,000
 Londoners, and the second by approximately 2,000 people across the UK.
 This strand contributes to the literature, building on the previous research
 surveyed above, in a number of ways.

GIS Most existing studies have access to EQ data and respondent location
 only at ward level (or worse).
 By contrast, most of the EQ data we use is of 25m resolution or better.
 We have full UK postcodes for all respondents, and in the London survey
 we ask respondents to locate their home even more precisely using an interactiv
e map.
 This additional precision in location is particularly important in relation
 to air pollution and noise estimates, since these parameters may vary over
 very short distances.

 in which we do not improve upon existing literature in ways that we we
 would ideally like --- are that we do not seek to determine the causality
 of the associations we investigate, and we do not employ spatial econometric
 models that might help deal with omitted spatial covariates of our explanatory
 variables.
