\begin_layout Chapter
Literature review: happiness and environmental quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Why might happiness and EQ be linked?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define environmental quality (EQ) broadly as the presence of environmental
 goods --- such as natural landscapes, scenic views, or biodiversity ---
 and the absence of environmental 'bads', such as air pollution or noise.
 There are several reasons for hypothesising that EQ will be positively
 related to happiness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Habitats, psychology & evolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hypotheses regarding the landscapes or habitats considered to be environmental
 goods --- for example, what is it that makes a scenic view scenic? ---
 are generally of a (proximately) psychological and (ultimately) evolutionary
 kind.
 Such hypotheses, of which 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hartig:2010"

\end_inset

 provide a survey, try to explain how selective pressures have shaped the
 human mind so that is attracted to particular habitats or habitat characteristi
cs.
 Although evolutionary hypotheses are rarely testable, they can provide
 helpful starting points for empirical research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several authors have posited an innate human emotional affiliation to nature
 and other living organisms in general, for which 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, arising as an adaptation to our reliance on the natural environment throughout
 all but the past 10,000 years of our history.
 Affinities with more specific habitats, including savanna and forest, have
 been postulated similarly, on the basis that these habitats would have
 provided our hominin ancestors with the greatest reproductive success 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "orians:1980,falk:2010,han:2007"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Preferences concerning certain characteristics of habitats, and the reasons
 underlying these, have also been conjectured: for example, the abundance
 of locations from which one may see but not be seen, enabling one to attain
 goals while evading hazards (Prospect-Refuge theory), or the ease with
 which spatial information can be acquired and processed, permitting rapid
 understanding of the environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "appleton:1975,hartig:2010"

\end_inset

.
 Yet more abstractly, preferences have been suggested over shapes or patterns
 characteristic of natural scenes, such as fractal dimension, energy levels
 at certain spatial frequencies, or ratios of colour contrast to luminance
 contrast 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, positive effects of natural environments can be recast as an
 absence of the negative effects of non-natural, urban environments.
 Urban environments may have negative impacts because of the high levels
 of arousal, stress, or directed attention they engender or require 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ulrich:1991"

\end_inset

.
 According to Kaplan's Attention Restoration Theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "kaplan:1995"

\end_inset

 and Ulrich's broader 'psycho-evolutionary theory' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ulrich:1991"

\end_inset

 the lack of these factors in natural environments --- as well as the presence
 of certain other characteristics --- therefore permits stress recovery
 and attention restoration.

\begin_layout Subsection
Environmental bads, physical & mental health

Environmental bads, many of which are more prevalent in urban environments,
 may affect happiness via significant and direct negative impacts on physical

Adverse health effects of noise and air pollution are well documented.
 Chronic traffic noise exposure in urban environments can cause severe sleep

As noted by

, this pathway does not require that individuals are conscious of the causal
 relationship between the environmental problem and their own happiness.
 However, awareness of a local environmental problem, and of its negative
 effects on human and ecosystem health, could also act to reduce happiness
 levels directly and independently.
 There is evidence that individuals' perceptions of air pollution are positively
 related to objective pollution measures, as well as to broader evaluations
 of their local environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "day:2007"

 Individuals are generally aware of the sources of pollution (principally,
 main roads), of its fluctuation according to weather conditions, and of
 the negative health effects with which it is associated, especially for
 children 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This makes individuals' perceptions of air pollution an additional route
 by which the pollution may influence their happiness.

 And secondly, it may do so by providing spaces both for social interaction
 and for outdoor recreation and exercise, which also help reduce anxiety
 and depression levels and improve self-esteem and health (ibid.;

 Since health is invariably found to be a major determinant of LS levels,
 it seems safe to assume that improving health also realises significant
 LS gains.

Most such studies report beneficial impacts of natural environments on health
 or wellbeing, but they have some common weaknesses.
 Observational studies measure domestic proximity to natural environments
 but not actual experiences of such environments (which may not occur near
 home, and may occur elsewhere); cannot provide data on the moment-by-moment
 hedonic or affective element of wellbeing; and are reliant on retrospective
 assessments that are subject to substantial recall bias

London also differs from the UK average in many demographic and socio-economic
 parameters that could affect LS.
 Out of all UK regions, it has: the highest inward and outward migration;
 the youngest and most ethnically diverse population; the greatest number
 of households of unrelated adults, lone parents, multiple families and
 single people; the greatest proportion of children below the poverty threshold
 (40%); and the highest levels of concern over violent crime

 bottom quintiles of UK income after housing costs (28% and 26% respectively)

In respect of access to nature, London is one of the largest cities in the
 developed world in terms of built-up area, with most residents thus some
 distance from any wild natural environment.
 However, London also has more parks and green spaces than any other city
 of comparable size worldwide

In this and following statistics from the Greater London Authority's (GLA)
 Annual London Survey, a 'significant' problem is interpreted as one rated
 1 or 2 on a scale from 1 ('a major problem') to 5 ('no problem at all').
 This follows the GLA's own interpretation in the Mayor's Air Quality Strategy

Air pollution, however, is probably the biggest single environmental issue
 in London.
 Although the notorious 'pea-souper' smogs of the 1950s are long gone, London's
 air quality is still the worst in the UK and among the worst in Europe,
 consistently failing annual objectives for nitrogen dioxide and particulates

An additional source of pollution distinctive to London is particulates
 on the Underground system, and the well-publicised calculation that every
 20 minutes spent travelling on the Northern line is equivalent to smoking
 one cigarette

 The Central London Congestion Charging Scheme (CC), when introduced in
 February 2003, reduced nitrogen oxides and particulates by an average of
 16% along major roads, but its limited zone and hours of operation have
 made consequent medium-term emissions reductions difficult to detect

 The London Low Emission Zone (LEZ), to be implemented progressively between
